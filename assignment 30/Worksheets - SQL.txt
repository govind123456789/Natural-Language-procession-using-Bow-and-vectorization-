Q11 to Q15 are subjective answer type questions, Answer them briefly. 
11. What is data-warehouse? 
Answer - A Data Warehousing is process for collecting and managing data from varied sources to provide meaningful business insights. A Data warehouse is typically used to connect and analyze business data from heterogeneous sources. The data warehouse is the core of the BI system which is built for data analysis and reporting.
12. What is the difference between OLTP VS OLAP?
Answer -An OLTP system captures and maintains transaction data in a database. Each transaction involves individual database records made up of multiple fields or columns. Examples include banking and credit card activity or retail checkout scanning.
OLAP applies complex queries to large amounts of historical data, aggregated from OLTP databases and other sources, for data mining, analytics, and business intelligence projects. In OLAP, the emphasis is on response time to these complex queries. Each query involves one or more columns of data aggregated from many rows. 
 13. What are the various characteristics of data-warehouse?
Answer - There are three prominent data warehouse characteristics:

Integrated: The way data is extracted and transformed is uniform, regardless of the original source.
Time-variant: Data is organized via time-periods (weekly, monthly, annually, etc.).
Non-volatile: A data warehouse is not updated in real-time. It is periodically updated via the uploading of data, protecting it from the influence of momentary change
 14. What is Star-Schema?? 
Answer - In data warehousing and business intelligence (BI), a star schema is the simplest form of a dimensional model, in which data is organized into facts and dimensions.  A fact is an event that is counted or measured, such as a sale or login.  A dimension contains reference information about the fact, such as date, product, or customer. A star schema is diagramed by surrounding each fact with its associated dimensions.
15. What do you mean by SETL? 
Answer -  A programming language developed by Jack Schwartz in the early 1970s. It is based on set theory and used for mathematical and telecommunications applications. See ALICE and set theory.
