Q11 to Q13 are subjective questions, answer them briefly 
11. Differentiate between a list, tuple, set and dictionary.
Answer -A list is a mutable, ordered sequence of items. As such, it can be indexed, sliced, and changed. Each element can be accessed using its position in the list.
Tuples are used to hold together multiple objects. Think of them as similar to lists, but without the extensive functionality that the list class gives you. One major feature of tuples is that they are immutable like strings i.e. you cannot modify tuples.
A set stores distinct values of the same type in a collection with no defined ordering. You can use a set instead of an array when the order of items is not important, or when you need to ensure that an item only appears once.
A dictionary stores associations between keys of the same type and values of the same type in a collection with no defined ordering. Each value is associated with a unique key, which acts as an identifier for that value within the dictionary.
 12. Are strings mutable in python? Suppose you have a string “I+Love+Python”, write a small code to replace ‘+’ with space in python. 
Answer -No, Strings are immutable in python. You cannot change any character of a string, but you can append two strings by adding them.To change the string you have to create a new sring variable and add the required changes iteratively.

13. What does the function ord() do in python? Explain with example. Also, write down the function for getting the datatype of a variable in python. 
Answer -The ord() function returns the number representing the unicode code of a specified character.
