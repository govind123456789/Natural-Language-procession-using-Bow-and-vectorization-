       " 'When two brothers fell critically ill with\\n\\naround the same time in March, their doctors were baffled. Both were young -- 29 and 31 years old -- and healthy. Yet within days they couldn’t breathe on their own and, tragically, one of them died.\\n\\nTwo weeks later, when a second pair of Covid-stricken brothers, both in their 20s, also appeared in the Netherlands, geneticists were called in to investigate. What they uncovered was a path leading from severe cases,\\n\\n, and gender differences to a loss of immune function that may ultimately yield a new approach to treating thousands of\\n\\npatients.\\n\\nThe common thread in the research is the lack of a substance called\\n\\nthat helps orchestrate the body’s defense against viral pathogens and can be infused to treat conditions such as infectious hepatitis. Now, increasing\\n\\nsuggests that a significant minority of Covid-19 patients get very ill because of an\\n\\nresponse. Twin landmark studies published Thursday in the journal Science showed that\\n\\ninterferon may lurk at a dangerous turning point in SARS-CoV-2 infections.\\n\\n“It looks like this virus has one big trick,” said\\n\\n, a professor in the Center for Infectious Disease and Vaccine Research at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology in California. “That big trick is to avoid the initial innate immune response for a significant period of time and, in particular, avoid an early type-1 interferon response.”\\n\\nThe work highlights the potential for interferon-based\\n\\nto enlarge a slowly accumulating range of Covid-19 treatments. These include Gilead Sciences Inc.’s remdesivir and convalescent plasma, a component of the blood of recovered patients that may contain beneficial immune factors.\\n\\nThese treatments provide limited benefit and are typically used in very sick, hospitalized patients. The\\n\\nthat interferon may help some people is enticing because it appears most efficacious in the early stages of infection, when life-threatening respiratory failure could still be averted. Dozens of studies of interferon treatment are now\\n\\nCovid-19 patients.\\n\\n“We think timing may be essential because it’s only in the very early phase one can really battle the virus particles and defend against infection,” said\\n\\n, head of the genomic technologies and immuno-genomics group at Radboud University Medical Center in Nijmegen that analyzed the DNA of the two sets of brothers.\\n\\nBeing male, elderly, and having underlying medical conditions can all raise patients’ risk of life-threatening Covid-19. But even within these groups, disease severity varies widely. Scientists have speculated other factors influence susceptibility, including pre-existing levels of inflammation and immunity, the amount of virus that starts an infection, and patients’\\n\\n.\\n\\nNew nexus\\n\\nInterferon’s role represents a new nexus in Covid-19’s complex interaction with the human immune system. Many patients suffer their worst complications because of an immune overreaction sometimes called a cytokine storm, and may benefit from dexamethasone, a cheap generic that calms these storms.\\n\\n“It’s a very interesting disease because too little immunity is no good,” Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Sept. 10 in an on-line briefing for Massachusetts General Hospital staff. “Too much immunity is really, really bad.”\\n\\nWhether sufficient interferon is available early or late in Covid-19 cases has a major bearing on disease severity, according to Yuen Kwok-Yung, chair of infectious diseases in the University of Hong Kong’s department of microbiology. Ideally, production of the antiviral substance would be triggered when immune cells encounter SARS-CoV-2 genetic material, stopping rapid viral reproduction inside the body and averting complications, he said.\\n\\n“But the SARS-CoV-2 virus has anti-interferon genes which can stop or antagonize the production or effect of interferon,” said Yuen, who\\n\\nin human lung tissue. If the interferon response is delayed and the amount of virus in the body peaks at a high level, other parts of the immune system will be “awakened.”\\n\\n‘Really disastrous’\\n\\nThat may trigger lung-injuring inflammation -- collateral damage from an excessive immune reaction to the virus. “This is really disastrous,” he said.\\n\\nSome people are known to have trouble fighting infections because they make antibodies that deactivate their own interferon. On Thursday, a global consortium of researchers said such immune reactions to the protein could account for life-threatening Covid-19 pneumonia in at least 2.6% of women and 12.5% of men.\\n\\nInterferon-blocking antibodies appeared in 101 of 987 patients with severe disease, but none of 663 people with an asymptomatic or mild case, according to\\n\\nin Science. Patients over age 65 were also more likely than younger ones to have the autoimmune abnormality, which was “clinically silent until the patients were infected with SARS-CoV-2,” the group of more than 100 scientists said.\\n\\n‘First explanation’\\n\\n“These findings provide a first explanation for the excess of men among patients with life-threatening Covid-19 and the increase in risk with age,” the researchers led by\\n\\n, head of Rockefeller University’s St. Giles Laboratory of Human Genetics of Infectious Diseases in New York said. “They also provide a means of identifying individuals at risk of developing life-threatening Covid-19.”\\n\\nThose genetic flaws were similar to the ones that Hoischen and his colleagues from a dozen Dutch centers\\n\\nin the Journal of the American Medical Association two months ago. The two sets of brothers had inherited a gene mutation that impaired the interferon response, keeping their immune systems from fighting the coronavirus until it had replicated for days.\\n\\nIn the Dutch men, the effects were cruel. The first, a young father from a town in the southern Netherlands, suffered shortness of breath, cough and fever at home for eight days before admission to intensive care. He was to spend 33 days in the hospital, 10 of them on a ventilator.\\n\\nRaging fever\\n\\nHis 29-year-old brother succumbed to Covid-19 in an intensive care unit in Rotterdam, after being treated for shock and a fever that soared to 44 degrees Celsius (111 degrees Fahrenheit). When doctors at Radboud learned of his younger sibling’s case, as well as a second pair -- 21- and 23-year-old brothers also in respiratory failure -- they went looking for a genetic cause.\\n\\nThey found a mutation that was carried on the X chromosome. Defects on this\\n\\nare more likely to affect men, who have only one copy, while women have two.\\n\\nThe men’s mutations are rare -- occurring in 1 in 10,000 people -- and an unlikely explanation for the vast majority of severe Covid-19 cases. But the studies in Science indicate that various forms of interferon dysfunction may underlie as many as 14% of critical patients, and that screening and targeted treatment might prevent severe illnesses and deaths.\\n\\n“If we manage to get them into our university medical center early enough,” Hoischen said, “our clinicians may be able to treat them with interferons.”\\n\\nOther ways of overcoming autoimmunity, like the removal of antibodies against interferon from the blood, called plasmapheresis, could also help patients. On the other hand, patients who produce antibodies against interferon shouldn’t donate blood products for treating other patients.\\n\\n“The rare diseases and the more common forms of the same disease may converge, and we can learn from each other,” said Hoischen. “That’s the hope.”',\n",

Gone so young. It\\'s very sad that he had to pass away in my city, and at a time when I couldn\\'t even meet him. I\\'m very sorry for Jane (his wife) and the kids,\" he said.Shastri remembers Jones as a laugh-a-minute colleague, with a very good sense of humour and great fun to work with. \"With him around, there was electricity. All the time I\\'ve known him, he was a livewire. I\\'m 58, he was 59, and I\\'ve known him since 1986 - that\\'s almost 35 years. I will never forget him hosting me at his home for the Christmas-day lunch during the 2003-04 India tour of Australia,\" the India coach said.In the mid and late 80s, Shastri said, \"Dean Jones was among the best One-day batsmen in the world, on par with Viv (Richards) and Javed ( Miandad )\".Calling him a \"terrific entertainer\" in white ball cricket during his time, Shastri said, \"He was ahead of his time in the 50-over format, had an attacking style, his running between the wickets was excellent and he was right there at the top.\"Shastri and Jones first played Test cricket against each other when India toured Australia in 1985-86 for a three-Test series followed by Australia touring India soon thereafter.\"His 210 at Chepauk , battling the heat and humidity, was an exemplary effort.

       " 'NEW DELHI: American cult bikemaker Harley-Davidson , often used by US President Donald Trump in trade diplomacy with India, is shutting down its only factory in India on below-par business as it takes a hard call to exit markets where sales continue to remain weak and outlook stands shaky.In its decade-long presence in India, the company has sold over 25,000 units and today has 33 dealerships, which, too, may shut down or be scaled down massively. It is estimated that the move involves $75 million in restructuring costs, and job losses for some 70 remaining employees (it had been reducing manpower over the past few months).Harley, is, however, close to striking a partnership with a homegrown brand, most likely to be Hero MotoCorp of Pawan Munjal, sources told TOI. While refraining to provide details about its future plans, the company said it is \"changing its business model\" in India and \"evaluating options\" to continue to serve its customers.TOI had first reported about Harley’s plans to scale down India business in its edition dated August 6 this year, while also reporting about partnership plans with Hero Moto in the February 19 and September 8 editions.Harley is not the only company to have exited India. Other on the list include General Motors and MAN Trucks, while Ford has also quit solo operations and has joined hands with Mahindra & Mahindra.\"Harley-Davidson plans to close its manufacturing facility in Bawal and significantly reduce the size of its sales office in Gurgaon. The company is communicating with its customers in India and will keep them updated on future support,\" the company said in a statement. \"The Harley-Davidson dealer network will continue to serve customers through the contract term.\"Harley’s exit comes at a time when the Indian economy and the auto industry are passing through one of their toughest periods ever as coronavirus-induced slowdown and poor consumer demand have depressed sales to historic lows. Also, companies have complained of high duty and tax structure on the automobile industry, and those voicing concern include Maruti Suzuki, Mahindra & Mahindra, Toyota, Hero Moto, Bajaj Auto, and TVS.Even President Trump has often raked up the issue of \"high\" import duty that Harley bikes faced in India (he called it \"unfair\"), even taking it up with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Trump’s complaints had led the Centre to reduce the duty on Harley motorcycles from 100% to 50%, though the US government still remained unsatisfied.Harley’s exit from manufacturing in India may be a dampener for India’s trade discussions with the US, as the latter may continue to blame the import duty structure.Harley’s problems, however, were more than just adverse duty structure. In a price-sensitive market, the company failed to bring affordable models (its lowest powered on sale in India is the Street 750cc, priced at Rs 4.7 lakh ex-showroom) in line with the demand of the broader market, despite doing local assembly at Bawal. Its India product portfolio was a mix of locally assembled models (through imported kits), apart from imported bikes.While Harley did manage to create an aura around cruisers and leisure riding, especially through its famed HOG programme (where it had 6,500 members), the move ended up helping local brand Royal Enfield more that saw a massive growth in demand. Led by promoter Siddhartha Lal, Enfield — often seen as \"India’s Harley\" by the middle class — has been on a roll over the past few years and plans to become the world’s biggest mid-engine motorcycle maker across the world.Harley has also been slow in striking a partnership with local players, even though other companies managed to do so. German BMW has partnered TVS Motors for lower-powered bikes, while UK’s Triumph has joined hands with Bajaj Auto.Harley said the India strategy change is happening as part of a new plan called \"The Rewire\", which aims at an overhaul of its operating model and market structure. \"These actions are aligned with \\'The Rewire\\' which is planned to continue through the end of 2020, leading to \\'The Hardwire\\', a new strategic plan for 2021-2025 aimed at building desirability for the Harley-Davidson brand and products,\" its statement said.It is believed that Mahindra & Mahindra and Bajaj Auto also had talks with Harley, though the company prefers Hero Moto. On the questions of a partnership with Harley, Hero chairman Pawan Munjal had earlier told TOI, \"If they want to (enter into a partnership), then why not? Sure... I am open to the right kind of match… The sooner it happens, it\\'s good for everyone.\"',\n",

While SGNP leopards often strayed into Aarey, with the addition of 800 acres, it will become their legitimate stomping ground.Confirming the development, SGNP Director G Mallikarjun said the land will be first taken over from Aarey by the Revenue Department and then declared reserve forest. “The 800 acre is spread over Goregaon village,in revenue records,” he said.A senior cabinet minister said that around 825 acres will be declared as a reserve forest. It will include the Aarey Colony but not the site of the Metro 3 car shed since no formal decision to shift the car shed has been taken so far.Whilehas been pushing for saving Aarey Colony, Forest Minister Sunil Kedar took the lead in connecting it to SGNP.“There will be a process of suggestions and objections.

The price of 200 ml plasma unit too has been cut by 25% and capped at Rs 5,500.\\n\\nThe decisions follow complaints from patients of being overcharged or blackmarketing in case of plasma. Dr Sudhakar Shinde, CEO of the State Health Assurance Society, who headed the committee set up to decide on the HRCT price capping, told TOI that “the cost of HRCT has been between Rs5,000 and Rs1,0000 in some five-star hospitals.”\\n\\nRadiologists performing CT scans for Covid-19 patients will not only have to report on the lungs, but also mention details of other organs. “Doctors were following a short-cut method of only reporting on lungs, but if a patient is undergoing a scan full of radiation, he or she should be told about other organs as well,” said Dr Shinde. The cost of CT (HRCT) scan includes the price of PPE, disinfectants, etc.\\n\\nHRCT emerged as a key diagnostic tool for Covid-19, while convalescent plasma is being used to treat mild to moderately ill patients.\\n\\nWhile a 200 ml unit of plasma extracted using the plasmapherisis method has been capped at Rs5,500 per bag, the average cost in most hospitals in Mumbai is between Rs7,000 and Rs 7,500.\\n\\nIn the early phase of the Covid pandemic, high-resolution CT scan (HRCT) had emerged as a life-saving tool for city doctors. The ‘ground glass’ opacities in the CT scans of the lungs helped doctors decide on the severity of the disease in patients whose tests results were taking days to arrive.\\n\\n“RT-PCR only has a sensitivity of 70% to diagnose Covid-19, while antigen tests have 50% sensitivity. However, HRCT has over 80% sensitivity,” said Dr Shashank Joshi, who is a member of the state task force on Covid-19. “It is a useful tool to understand the severity of the disease. The capping will make it more accessible for the common man,” he added.\\n\\nConvalescent plasma is in demand for treatment of Covid-19 patents after the ministry allowed for off-label or emergency use of plasma.\\n\\nThe state government appointed an expert committee with the help of the State Blood Transfusion Council. The committee has fixed the rates keeping in view the cost of collecting plasma by plasma apheresis method and the service charges for additional tests/special tests on blood as per the National Blood Policy. If the plasma bag is provided with a NAT test, the charges for the test have been capped at Rs1,200 per test (excluding the cost of plasma bag) and Rs 500 for a chemiluminescence test done on the plasma unit.\\n\\n“The almost 25% cut in the rate of 200ml of plasma is good for patients. The capping exercise will introduce checks and balances and control blackmarketing,’’ said Dr Om Shrivastava, infectious diseases specialist, who is a member of the state task force on Covid.\\n\\nThe first plasma trial findings by the ICMR over a month back showed that it didn’t affect mortality rates. However, many doctors have said plasma has a role to play in mild to moderately ill patients.\\n\\n“With the capping of rates, plasma will be available to patients at a nominal rate. The government will take strict action like revoking licences of blood banks which do not implement the rate and are found to overcharge,” said state health minister Rajesh Tope.\\n\\n',\n",

The chances of earning something by taking up any work were brighter in Nigdi,” Gore told TOI.He travels in the periphery of 25km from his village for any agricultural work. “I get Rs 200 for half a day, and Rs 400 for a full day’s work,” he said.But work is not always available even though farm operations are at their peak in the monsoon. Gore is worried about getting any work once the agriculture operations are over.Born into a Dhangar (nomadic shepherding community) family, Gore has lived life only the hard way. Despite financial constraints, his mother insisted he complete his education.“I would run away to mind the flock instead of going to school,” he said. But he completed his post-graduation in Marathi from Shivaji University in Kolhapur His novel reflects rural trials, one of the many he is going through himself. ‘Fesati’ is about the struggles of shepherds, landless labourers and marginal land holders in agrarian Maharashtra Natha Gore, the main character, represents the plight of a large number of rural youths.‘Fesati’ is a farm implement made from bamboo to drop seeds for sowing, ensuring zero wastage of the seeds. It also symbolises the struggle in rural parts.“I have seen tragedies strike farmers, I have experienced dreams getting shattered in rural areas. Still, the sheer will of ordinary people has inspired me at a personal level” he told TOI in an interview in June 2018.',\n",
       " 'Century-old Parsi Gate, Marine Drive\\n\\nMUMBAI: A group of concerned citizens started an online petition to save the Parsi Gate at Marine Drive, which is likely to be relocated by BMC for the coastal road. The petition says the over one century-old gate, built by Pallonji Mistry and philanthropist Bhagojisheth Kheer in 1915, has been in existence before Marine Drive was built. Within a few hours, the petition had over 1,000 signatures.\\n\\n“The gate is carved with Zoroastrian motifs and made of Malad stone with steps between them to access the beach now called Chotta Chowpatty where all Mumbaikars could offer their prayers and offerings to the sea,” said Havovi Sukhadwala, who initiated the petition.\\n\\n“Zoroastrians of Mumbai have been paying their respect to Avan Yazad [water deity] for over a century at the Parsi Gate. Hindus particularly use this safe access constructed to immerse the offerings on Poornima and ashes from the Chandanwadi crematorium at Marine Lines,” it said. The petition said the gate was identified as a place of worship in the 2016 Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) report of Coastal Road project, which BMC has now decided to remove and relocate a kilometre away. This, it said, “constitutes change or alteration as defined under Section 2(b) of The Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991”.\\n\\nSukhadwala said BMC has not sought an NOC from the Mumbai Heritage Conservation Committee. “The Parsi Gate is indeed the work of master craftsmen, whose labour of love has withstood the vastitude of the Arabian Sea, as admired by anyone who has stood at The Parsi Gate.

       " 'MUMBAI: While a high percentage of pregnant women in Maharashtra have tested positive for Covid, only one in every 10 of these positive women had symptoms. This is the gist of a new research paper by the National Institute for Research in Reproductive Health (NIRRH), Parel, after analyzing data from the Preg-Covid registry network.Every pregnant woman in the country has to undergo a Covid-19 test ahead of her delivery date. “The ICMR in April introduced universal screening for pregnant women to check the spread of the disease,” said the study’s main author Dr Rahul Gajbhiye. The study is scheduled to be published in the European Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology and Reproductive Biology. As per the tests carried out among 1,140 pregnant women at 15 state government medical colleges between April 25 and May 20, 141 were positive for virus. “This works out to a positivity rate of 12.3% among pregnant women. While this may seem high in comparison to the spread among the general population, it must be considered that all pregnant women were screened, while not everyone in the general population is,’’ said Dr Gajbhiye.However, NIRRH director Dr Smita Mahale said the main concern is the high percentage of asymptomatic patients. The NIRRH team then studied the 141 positive pregnant women from the state government hospitals along with 180 positive pregnant women who delivered at BMCrun Nair Hospital and found only 37 were symptomatic.“This means the rest or 88.5% didn’t have any symptoms,” said Dr Mahale. If they hadn’t been tested, they would have spread the virus to others in the hospitals. Dr Deepak Modi, a co-author in the study, said, “Screening pregnant women is important not because they are at a higher risk of catching the infection, but also because they could spread it if they are unaware of their status.”',\n",

A helpline number should be provided to address technical queries. Despite all the measures, if students suffer due to lack of connectivity or device problems on the day of the exam, they should be allowed to attempt the test again. Many students will be anxious to give their final exam in the online format in the absence of physical invigilators. Colleges and universities should take this into account while framing exam rules.\\n\\nMUMBAI: With the backlog exams (ATKT) for final-year students starting Friday, several colleges rushed to conduct the online mock tests this week. While many students found the sample questions easy, some reported technical glitches and inconvenience attempting the test in the online format.The state government and Mumbai University guidelines made it mandatory for colleges to conduct mock tests before holding online exams to familiarise students with the format.At an engineering college in central Mumbai, students were informed about the mock tests just two hours in advance. “No one was prepared. Our teachers asked us to attempt it anyway to get used to the format. Some students were not available as the portal was opened for a limited period. It was conducted in the most haphazard manner,” said a student. Some students with ATKTs found their schedule overlapping with the mock tests for regular final-year exams.In another cluster, 80% of students managed to give the mock exams smoothly; the rest faced a few technical issues. “There were problems with email IDs that couldn’t be located. Mails went into spam, students had problems with mobile cameras, connectivity issues. Some even pressed the wrong keys in anxiety. The help desk managed to guide them and some were issued a re-test,” said the principal.At a law college in south Mumbai, the mock exams were smooth for students who took it on laptops or computers. “Those taking it on phones reported a problem. A student was getting a call, and though he disconnected it, he got a notification saying ‘unusual activity was detected’. If this happens several times, the exam will be terminated or it is likely to show ‘unfair means’...Even an antivirus alert will be considered ‘unusual activity’,” said a student. At the college, a translator app was used to translate English questions to Marathi for students who had opted for it—they used the literal translation of an 18th century jurist’s name, which was distorted, said the student.At a suburban law college, students had to give the mock tests on Google Forms, with a security feature. “The questions were simpler, but students had a window of only five minutes to log into the portal. On the actual exam day, if we face network issues and are unable to log in on time, will we lose an attempt to give the exam?” asked a student.Another engineering student said the syllabus covered till March 13—deadline set by the state—by colleges in their cluster was different. “Our college completed five modules, two others completed three. To have a common syllabus, the colleges in the cluster are likely to cover only three modules for the exam. What is the point of this evaluation,” he said.',\n",

As there was not much excess rainwater from Vihar lake flowing into Mithi even the river did not breach the banks.\\n\\nBMC officials also claimed that the waterlogging situation and vehicular traffic and train services affected on Wednesday were not as severe as on August 5, when most parts of the city had gone under water, causing hardships to Mumbaikars.\\n\\nMany politicans were, however, not convinced by the BMC claims. Samajwadi Party corporator and MLA Rais Shaikh said, “Nagpada and Agripada areas were badly affected on Wednesday as compared to August 5.

Delhi has implemented “Bijli Swaraj”—a strategy to shift to renewable energy and create green jobs and reduce dependency on fossil fuels. Punjab is making several efforts to control stubble burning .Different Indian states on Thursday showcased their actions being undertaken against climate change at an event titled “State Climate Leadership in India.” The event was hosted by The Climate Group in association with Delhi-based Climate Trends on the sidelines of the annual Climate Week NYC, which is being organised virtually this year due to Covid-19 pandemic.Delhi’s new electricity reforms can reduce close to 1.6mn tonnes of CO2 emissions annually, Roshan Shankar, adviser to Delhi government said while presenting his work at Climate Week NYC 2020. Shankar said not only had Delhi government launched a citizen-centric tariff subsidy with free electricity up to 200 units, Delhi’s solar policy 2016, its air quality declaration in 2019 and the Delhi Electric Vehicle Policy 2020 were also among initiatives to reduce dependence on fossil fuels.“Dwarka and Shakur Basti have a number of households that are now running through solar energy. For societies, Group Net Metering and Virtual Net Metering schemes are also allowing people to improve efficiency and save on cost, while giving electricity back to the grid,” Shankar added.Punjab, which has been under the scanner over stubble burning problem, said remedial measures have been in place since 2018, with the overall area under paddy reduced to 27 lakh hectares from 31.3 lakh hectares in 2018. The government was diversifying crops to promote a sustainable food production system.Phayeng village, which consists of less than 3,000 inhabitants, has been completely transformed from a barren, deforested land to a thriving ecosystem.

He said experts feel that the number of cases will be declining in the coming days though his government had its fingers crossed.His remarks came on a day when 3,834 cases and 36 deaths were reported. The number of containment zones too breached the 2,000 mark. The Delhi government's health bulletin on Thursday revealed that the number of containment zones stood at an all-time high of 2,059 as against 894 on September 1.District officials said the number of cases was rising due to aggressive testing, leading to creation of more containment zones. According to Thursday’s health bulletin, 59,183 tests were carried out and the positivity rate was 6.4%, well below the national average. Officials said they were creating micro containment zones now which had resulted in the total number of such zones showing a sharp increase.“Experts believe that the second wave which has hit Delhi seems to have perhaps reached its peak. It will decline in the days to come,” said the chief minister, speaking to reporters after visiting Indian Agricultural Research Institute.Kejriwal pointed out that the government had increased the number of containment zones from 550 in the middle of August to over 2,000 now and hoped that this expansion would help in bringing down the number of positive cases.The CM said coronavirus cases were by and large under control in the capital between July 1 and August 17 when the city was reporting 1,100 to 1,200 cases on an average daily. “The cases started going up from August 17. As a responsible government, we did not take any risk and immediately scaled up testing,” he said, adding that the daily tests were increased from around 20,000 to 60,000.Kejriwal said aggressive testing and isolation of positive cases were the most effective way of defeating Covid-19. Had the government scaled down the daily tests to the previous level of 20000, cases would have come down to around 1500 daily, he said.Out of the total 2,059 containment zones at present, 1,612 are active. This means these zones have live cases while the others don’t have any but have still not been declassified according to the protocol that has been laid down. On September 1, there were 699 active containment zones in the city.South West district, which is spread over a huge area, has 341 containment zones at present, the highest in Delhi. It has also till date seen the highest number of containment zones –610. The areas that have a large number of containment zones include Raj Nagar, Mahavir Enclave and Mohan Garden, apart from some areas in Najafgarh, Dwarka and Uttam Nagar.West district has the second highest number of red zones –234. The increase, however, has been sharp in case of North West, New Delhi, North East, South East and Central districts.North West district, which has a population of around 37 lakh according to the 2011 census, has seen an almost eightfold rise in the number of Covid-19 cases this month. On September 1, the district had 29 containment zones and by September 23, the number had risen to 229. The areas that have seen a large number of containment zones being created this month include some sectors of Rohini and blocks of Ashok Vihar, Pitampura and Budh Vihar.“The containment zones in North West district were earlier spread over a much bigger area and it was realised that this could lead to more positive cases. Creation of micro containment zones helps not only in more efficient management but reduces the spread,” said a district official.“The strategy was changed and the number of containment zones were increased by creating some very small ones. “Initially, the number of active cases here was 20% which has now increased to 24%, which is at par with other districts,” he said. “Also, testing has become much more aggressive now compared to last month,” he said.New Delhi district, which had 40 containment zones at the beginning of the month, has seen the number go up 164. The most affected areas are different sectors of RK Puram and Vasant Kunj, apart from Naraina and Munirka.North East district, which has the lowest number of containment zones – 72 – has also seen a three-fold increase from September 1, when the figure was 19.“Extensive testing is resulting in more positive cases being detected, and whenever we see clustering of cases happening in any area, we create a containment zone. With many migrants coming back to Delhi and more offices and businesses opening, it is natural that there would be a rise in cases,” said another district official.\",\n",

There is nothing to worry about at present,” the source added.Co-infection due to Covid-19 and dengue is emerging as a serious problem and doctors at several city hospitals have reported such instances in the past one week. “We don’t know much about possible complications associated with such co-infection as Covid-19 is a new disease. It is important to monitor such patients to ensure there is no sudden deterioration,” doctors say.Sisodia had tested positive for Covid-19 on September 14. Initially, he was under home isolation. He was admitted to Lok Nayak hospital on Wednesday when he complained about breathing difficulty.Earlier, on June 17, Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain had tested positive for Covid-19. He was admitted to Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty hospital initially but later shifted to the Max hospital for administration of plasma therapy after developing pneumonia and having breathing trouble. He recovered in about two weeks.“Both dengue and Covid-19 are viral illnesses with no known cure. In dengue, a patient can go into shock due to extremely low blood pressure, which warrants medications to increase the blood pressure. On the other hand, in Covid-19, high blood pressure is linked to higher fatality,” the doctors say.Public health specialists say measures to prevent seasonal illnesses, more importantly dengue, need to be implemented strictly.“We have seen more than 40 dengue cases already this year. Of that, one patient had Covid-19 also. Fortunately, the patient came within two days of the onset of fever and timely medical intervention helped reduce the risk of complications,” Dr Ashutosh Biswas, professor of medicine at AIIMS, said.

       " 'Bid for more accountability at DJB\\n\\nNEW DELHI: The operation, management and maintenance of water and sewage lines in Delhi will be handed over to private operators by Delhi Jal Board ( DJB ). Water procurement and supply will, however, continued to remain the responsibility of the water utility.In its board meet on Thursday, DJB approved the ‘One Zone, One Operator’ policy to enable private firms to take over the care and management of pipelines after the city is divided into 7-8 zones. These private firms will be appointed for 10 years.Ankit Srivastava, technical adviser to DJB, described the step as “not at all being akin to the privatisation of distribution of electricity in the power sector”. All work entrusted to the private companies will also remain under DJB’s supervision and no board employee will be laid off. Officials disclosed that notices calling for the new operators will be issued around October 1. The zones will be determined based on the hydraulics of the regions.After the meeting chaired by Delhi water minister and chairman of DJB Satyendar Jain on Thursday, Srivastava, explaining that the step was not a drastic change from the present setup, said, “To date, we issue many small tenders for repair and maintenance works by private contractors across the water supply network. Under the new model, these works will be consolidated among fewer companies. A defined area will be the responsibility of an operator with fixed deliverables for both water pipelines and sewerage.”Srivastava noted that the appointment of a single company in each defined zone will ensure accountability and guarantee quality work. “This is a precursor to 24x7 supply of water in the capital,” he added.A DJB official said that no board employee would be terminated in the process and no government post was being replaced by private players. “Also, DJB officials will continue to have supervisory roles. For example, even now the 200 sewer cleaning machines are managed by private players, but an DJB official always supervises the work.”The official added the new consultants would fix the nitty-gritty of works related to the water and sewer lines, including expansions of pipe size, repair, connections, etc. “Instead of dividing such work into hundreds of small packets, the whole can be entrusted to one company which will carry it out at one go,” the official argued. The only exceptions will be the three small areas where PPP projects on water supply improvement are being currently run.DJB manages around 14,500km of water pipelines and 9,000 km of sewer lines to ensure water supply and sewage services to 20 million people in Delhi. The board is responsible for the procurement of raw water, its treatment and the supply. “DJB currently takes wastewater from New Delhi Municipal Council and Delhi Cantonment Board areas, both of which are responsible for the provision of local sewer networks within their own territories,” the official said.The water utility said that extensive deliberations at various levels were held before it was decided to induct private operators for the operation, maintenance and management of the water and sewage networks. While studying the models in other cities, it was noticed that only a single operator had been appointed. “Delhi being a large metropolitan city will have to be divided in 7-8 zones,” one official said. “The zonation will be done through hydraulic studies of the region, underground reservoir areas and sewage outfall boundaries.”DJB has also approved of a simplified procedure for a new water and sewage connection. The online process will be paperless and integrated with the doorstep delivery of public services. The board has cleared the proposal to install 200 tubewells in the floodplain at Palla in a phased manner to extract raw water supply. An official added that the board also discussed the implementation of the polluter-pays principle as directed by National Green Tribunal.',\n",
       " 'NEW DELHI: Three people, including a 12-year-old boy, were killed and three others injured after a speeding Cluster Scheme bus lost control on a flyover in northeast Delhi’s Nand Nagri late on Thursday night. The bus rammed into several vehicles and street vendors before coming to a stop. Angry local residents pelted stones at the bus and broke its windows.Police received a call about the accident around 10pm on Thursday. Eyewitnesses told the cops that the Cluster bus was coming down the ITI flyover near Nand Nagri when it seemed to careen out of control. “The bus was moving at a high speed and first rammed into a truck, after which it mowed down pedestrians and hit the street vendors before stopping. The deceased were walking on the road when they were mowed down. The driver of the bus fled from the site, leaving the bus there,” said Ved Prakash Surya, DCP (Northeast).Two of the three men who died in the accident have been identified as Ravinder (22) and Karan (12). The identity of the third, aged around 40, is yet to be established. The injured include a teenager, Sujeet (16) and the husband-wife duo of Satish (45) and Kanchan (35). The three were taken to Swami Dayanand Hospital in the area for treatment.“A case of rash and negligent driving causing death has been registered,” said DCP Surya. “The situation in the area is under control.” Several police teams have been formed to track the missing bus driver.Soon after the accident, several local residents gathered at the junction near Nand Nagri. Police sources revealed that some people had spread rumours about the death of 5-6 people, leading to the locals getting agitated and damaging the bus.In a video of the incident shot by a local, several people can be seen pelting stones at the Cluster bus which stands by the roadside. The video also shows young boys later kicking a PCR van that was trying to make its way out of the area. A crowd can be seen building up on the road even as police officials make attempts to disperse the people.',\n",
       " 'BENGALURU: With Covid-19 fatalities surging and cemeteries and crematoriums struggling to keep pace, the government has decided to set up designated burial grounds and crematorium across all major cities and towns in the state. In Bengaluru, the government plans to develop nine new crematoriums in addition to the existing 10.“We have already invited tenders and work will begin soon. We have decided against developing designated burial grounds because of want of land and stiff opposition from residents,” said BBMP commissioner N Manjunatha Prasad. “Before crematoriums used to get 100 to 120 bodies, but now they get 165 or more,” Prasad said.Municipal administration and urban development departments have already asked district deputy commissioners and civic body chiefs to identify open land to streamline disposal of Covid-19 bodies.“Each of these burial grounds and crematoriums will be developed at a cost of Rs 25-30 lakh. The idea is to ensure patients who have died of Covid-19 get a dignified farewell,” said municipal administration minister KC Narayana Gowda. “These burial grounds and cremation centres will be reserved so that there is no confusion or commotion.”The government plans to earmark one acre of land for burial grounds and crematoriums in all 30 districts. All religions and sects that bury their dead will be allowed to use these grounds.Demands from communities who bury their dead to earmark space for last rites have been growing. But due to the shortage of burial grounds and stigma associated with Covid-19 fatalities, many bodies have been cremated. Residents living near burial grounds have also protested against burying Covid-19 dead there, while crematorium staffs have expressed anxiety in handling the bodies as they fear infection.The government has instructed managements of burial grounds to demarcate space to bury Covid fatalities and to erect ‘ Covid Graveyard ’ signboards besides preparing a separate approach. The site will be protected with barbed-wire and it will have security room, waiting hall, rest rooms and other facilities. Only five people will be allowed to attend the last rites and they will be given disposable masks and sanitisers by the Covid liaison officer in the hospital.',\n",

Since there was adequate stock, I was wondering what to do with the masks that Ishita had stitched and was keen on handing it over to NGOs.“A friend suggested I send it to jawans. About a month ago, I reached out to the deputy commissioner’s office to check if the courier could be sent through them. I was told that I could send it directly.

These cameras will be connected to a command centre where the police will monitor the violations.”Though the BPL has been put in place, it has not yet been effectively implemented for lack of manpower. A police official said that it has been a Herculean task as they cannot post personnel all along the road. Currently, many vehicles (other than the buses) intrude into the BPL thereby defeating the whole purpose. Hence, they have been demanding cameras to keep a tab on the violators. The BBMP officials said that the cameras will also help in keeping a tab on miscreants vandalising bollards or committing other petty crimes. Adriver said, “BPL has helped to provide us with a hassle-free drive along the ORR which houses hundreds of IT and other companies. If the service is efficient, then we will get many passengers. However, there are many problems with the BPL as many fail to follow the rules.”The total cost of the project to install cameras has been pegged at Rs 3 crore. The tender bids are likely to be opened by October 11 and the approvals are to be accorded by mid-October. The project is likely to start by the first week of November and if all goes well, the cameras will be functional from the first week of December, according to BBMP officials. This collaborative project has BBMP as the financial partner, the traffic police as the enforcement wing, DULT is chipping in with planning and BMTC being the end user is the operational partner.Currently, a pop-up bicycle lane is also being laid along the ORR. BMTC has also introduced cycle racks on its buses to stack cycles while cyclists travel in the buses. This will help in last mile connectivity too.',\n",

Hours before his arrest, he had been transferred and directed to report at the DGP’s office.\\n\\nLater, after legal formalities, Reddy was sent in judicial remand to Chanchalguda central prison till October 8.\\n\\nOn the second day of scrutiny, the ACB team unearthed four more acres in Shankarpally linked to a woman, reportedly a benami of the Rachakonda police officer, and found 300 grams of gold in a bank locker. ACB sleuths also stated that Reddy had deliberately undervalued properties in purchase agreements to ensure family assets would not appear disproportionate.\\n\\nAn ACB team analysing documents seized at Narasimha Reddy’s house at Mahendra Hills in Marredpally and residences of his benamis found that Reddy had obtained a Rs 90 lakh bank loan to run a hotel at Abdullapurmet on the one acre leased for 12 years by placing passbook of 4 acres 13 guntas agricultural land in Shankarpally.\\n\\nThe land is in the name of a 45-year-old woman suspected to be his benami. “The woman went to the US in June to see her daughters.

The persons who sold the plots received the property from their parents as gift deeds in 2016 and the deeds were registered in LB Nagar sub-registrar office. We are trying to identify and question the people who sold the land,” an ACB investigator said.\\n\\nACB personnel also found that Reddy had paid Rs 38 lakh on behalf of his wife to join an eight-flat apartment construction project at Puppalguda taken up by two ex-software employees on a 500-square yard after coming to an agreement with them that he would get two flats.\\n\\nThe agency claimed to have found out that Reddy had undervalued plots purchased at the time of registration so that value of assets owned by his family would not appear disproportionate. “Reddy had purchased a 222-square yard plot in Hafeezpet in his wife’s name for Rs 2.5 lakh in 2010. Similarly, he purchased 268-square yard plot in Pocharam a few years ago for Rs 78 lakh but in the agreement its value was shown as Rs 8 lakh. However, we secured the Rs 78 lakh transaction document from the person who sold the land,” an ACB official said.\\n\\nACB personnel also opened an Andhra Bank locker and found 300 grams gold. Two bank lockers of the woman who went to the US were yet to be opened. “A few weeks before the ACB raid, a news article appeared in a magazine about discreet inquiry being made against the ACP.

Researchers have used algorithms based on deep-learning to detect mobile-phone usage on a dataset. The algorithm runs at nearly 27 frames-per second on a high end graphics processing unit (GPU), which means it can process a video in real-time.\\n\\nDr Sparsh Mittal, the lead researcher, said, “We believe that our technique has immense potential. It can help in avoiding accidents due to distraction during driving. It can help improve productivity by preventing excess or untimely usage of the mobile phone.”\\n\\nThe algorithm can also help track mobiles being used at restricted places or lost phones. Explaining, Mittal said mobile phones are prohibited in many places such as petrol pumps, exam halls, embassies, military bases, and courts of law, and their tool can be used to find whether the mobile phone is being used in such areas. “Many financial transactions now happen on mobile phones, and hence, the loss of mobile phones can have severe consequences. By allowing tracking of mobile phone, our technique can help in detecting loss or theft of the mobile phone,” said Mittal.\\n\\nElaborating on this research, Poonam Rajput, research scholar at IITH, said, “ We have used algorithms based on deep-learning to detect mobile-phone usage. Our fastest algorithm runs at nearly 27 frames-per-second on a high-end GPU, which means it can process a video in real-time. Our algorithms achieve nearly 99% accuracy on the Kaggle Driver dataset and 96% accuracy on the IITH-DMU dataset.

       " 'CHENNAI: From being a car-owning and argumentative trial court lawyer to an absconding double murder suspect, lawyerK Ravi did it all during the five years of his underground living.Within a few months after killing his two children aged 13 and 11, and fleeing Chennai, Ravi sold his car in Odisha, stopped using his mobile phone to call anyone or ATM to withdraw money, worked as a construction labourer and slept at under-construction sites, and lifted gunny bags to earn a living. His caution did slip twice – once in Odisha and then in Delhi – but before police could nab him, he managed to escape.The cat-and-mouse game involving Ravi and the Maduravoyal police finally ended due to the pandemic-induced lockdown which immobilised Ravi and left him stuck at a nondescript lodge in Periyamet near Chennai Central railway station.Ravi shot to infamy on June 3, 2015, when his neighbours at CMDA Colony in Maduravoyal woke up to a foul smell emanating from his flat. It was only after the flat was broken into that the decomposing bodies of his children -- Aishwarya Priyadarshini and Jayakrishna Prabhu – were found. Investigation revealed that Ravi had struck his daughter with a sharp object and then strangulated his son and left their bodies on the bed. He had lit a candle under the cot and spread old clothes all around before opening the gas cylinder. “He had to fake a fire accident, but there was not enough gas in the cylinder,” an official said.Long before the murders, Ravi had stopped sending the children to school for a year. When the murder came to light, apart from his absence, Ravi’s brusque manner with the neighbours made him the prime suspect. CCTV footage showed that Ravi exited the apartments on May 28, a week before his children’s bodies were found.Three inspectors took over the case and several special teams searched for him, but to no avail. “This was a challenging case and the special teams were following it up,” said additional commissioner of police, A Arun.Ravi left the city in his sedan and toll records showed him crossing Andhra Pradesh border on May 30. Once police got wind of his presence in Bhubaneswar railway station, but they could not nab him. Ravi assumed a new identity and worked as a construction labourer and took up other menial jobs all these years in Odisha and Telengana.A special team led by Maduravoyal inspector Ravindran and sub inspector Chelladurai went to his native village near Madurai and decided to plant laundryman and petty shops owners in the locality as decoys.In August, police received a tip-off from a person at Ravi’s daughter’s school saying someone had approached them for the child’s transfer certificate. Police did track the person and his contact list showed a call from a mobile number belonging to Ravi. It is not clear as to why he was trying to retrieve the transfer certificate of his children, but that proved to be vital move that landed Ravi back on police radar. Then it was a matter of time before the long arm of law finally caught up with Ravi.Investigators are surprised Ravi never attempted to change his appearance, though he did try a beard for a while. He, however, diligently avoided contacting any of his acquaintances even once for at least for two years after he fled. Investigators say Ravi came to Chennai in January seeking monetary help from a friend. The unexpected lockdown in March, halted his escape plan. He then decided to stay put at the lodge as he thought police would be busy in pandemic-related work. This one time his calculations failed, and he got arrested.',\n",

The Union health ministry will introduce the vaccine against the viral infection if candidates prove their efficiency in the clinical trials. On Tuesday, the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO), the apex body for drug regulations , said it plans to approve Covid-19 vaccines that can provide immunity to at least 50% of participants in phase-3 clinical trials.The state is also a part of the countrywide trial of the Oxford vaccine. “We want to stay prepared so vaccinations can begin as soon as the drug is available,” Selvavinayagam said. The micro plans will identify vulnerable groups, place and process of vaccination. “While there will be an overarching central and state policy, the micro plan is to ensure we take into consideration the needs of districts, human resources and the infrastructure,” he said.The plan for Covid-19 vaccination will follow a specific format at the district, PHC and HSC level of the health districts. It will have details of doctors, nurses and health workers along with officials from police and revenue departments. A line list of pregnant women, new mothers, elderly and people with comorbid conditions such as diabetes, hypertension and other diseases will be prepared.Many pharmaceutical companies are preparing to produce enough doses of the vaccine, but when the vaccine is ready the state will ensure that it takes it fast to the public. “We have been able to successfully carry out the maternal health and child immunisation programme in rural areas and hilly terrains with an army of village health nurses and other health workers.

       " 'Tamil Nadu unit of the BJP seems to be in a dilemma over E V Ramasamy. The question seems to be — whether to openly accept some of the principles for which Periyar, as he is popularly known, stood for — even while vehemently opposing his stand on God.\\n\\nAfter taking head on the ideologies of the social reformer Periyar for years to build its vote bank by consolidating Hindu votes, the recent overtures — by BJP state president L Murugan towards Periyar — seem to have placed the party at a crossroads. Whatever be the reasons, Murugan’s praise for the social reformer’s principles, barring the one against Hinduism and its beliefs, have rattled a section of saffron party leaders and supporters.\\n\\nIt started with a ‘pointed question’ from the media, on September 17, when Murugan was addressing the press after celebrating Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s 70th birthday at the party headquarters in Chennai. A journalist asked him whether he would also greet Periyar on his 142nd birth anniversary. Incidentally, Periyar and Modi share their birthdays. \"He (Periyar) was a social reformer. We have no objection in expressing our greetings,\" Murugan had responded. In a separate development, on the same day, the party’s recently appointed vice-president K Annamalai advised party workers from addressing the social reformer as ‘Thanthai Periyar’, just as the Dravidian parties fondly addressed E V Ramasamy. \"Thanthai Periyar fought for social justice and for the downtrodden. Can’t say it better than this,\" Annamalai tweeted, tagging Murugan.\\n\\nThe whole issue would have ended there, had Murugan not commented again on Periyaar a couple of days later at Villupuram. \"Periyar has done a lot of social reforms. We will accept Periyar’s good principles. But, he said there is no God and we cannot accept that,\" Murugan replied, once again to a question.\\n\\n\"There is a difference between making a statement and responding to a ‘pointed’ question. As usual, the media is twisting it,\" said BJP spokesman Narayanan Thirupathy. According to him, the year 1925 was significant as sections of people came out of the Congress movement to chalk out their own political course. \"Both RSS and Periyar fought for social justice. But the ideologies of the two can never meet nor travel together,\" he said. \"While everyone works for the betterment of society in his or her own way, we have our own leaders and their contributions to the development of our society to talk about,\" Narayanan said.\\n\\nBut Murugan’s recent directive to the state unit’s IT wing — not to post tweets criticising Periyar — seems to have driven a wedge among party functionaries. \"We will not accept Periyar and his ideologies at any cost,\" said state president of BJP’s IT wing C T R Nirmal Kumar, who refused to confirm any such directive from Murugan. \"We are not for animosity against anyone and there is no need to hurt leaders, especially those who are no longer there. When saffron water was poured on a Periyar statue sometime back, we all criticised it,\" Thirupathy said.\\n\\nBJP general secretary Karu Nagarajan felt there is nothing wrong in agreeing to the views expressed by the state president (on Periyar). \"He reflects the party stand and it is not wrong to accept good principles,\" he said. But in the same vein, Nagarajan feels that it is time to look beyond Periyar.\\n\\n\"Times have changed. Today’s generation is fully tuned into the digital era. No one is opposing a widow’s remarriage. Girls are performing better than boys in public exams consistently. While we cannot ever accept his stand on God and the bashing of one community, most other principles of his have been accepted by all,\" he said.\\n\\nThere is a concentrated move by the party high command to shift the BJP’s narrative in Tamil Nadu to enhance its reach to a larger support base. \"It would be youth-centric and positive in approach. In this, personal attacks and demeaning of political leaders and icons like Periyar do not have any place,\" said a senior BJP leader close to Murugan and Annamalai.\\n\\nPolitical critic Kolahala Srenivaas feels the BJP’s state leaders are embracing Periyar for popular politics to appease the masses, without understanding the core ideology of the party. \"It will neither help the party to sustain their inherent vote bank nor expand it,\" he said. While Periyar coined ‘Dravidianism’ as a concept to whip up regional feelings and against the concept of India, it was diagonally opposite to the BJP’s core ideology of nationalism, he said.\\n\\nOthers, however, differ. \"It is good that BJP has understood the importance of Periyar in Tamil Nadu and his impact on the state’s politics. Murugan’s statements (on Periyar) are toeing the line of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who often praises Dr Ambedkar. By criticising a mass leader like Periyar, the BJP was distancing itself from Tamil Nadu voters. By recognising him (Periyar), Murugan has made a welcome move and a right approach that could help them gain ground in the state,\" said political analyst M Kasinathan.\\n\\n',\n",

Party national general secretary Ram Madhav and national secretary Sunil V Deodhar are said to be frontrunners for the post. Both are known for their aggressive poll strategies, the source said.\\n\\n“Ram Madhav is familiar with the two Dravidian parties and the state politics. He played a vital role in strengthening the BJP in the eastern part of the country. If he is made TN in-charge, it will help the party strike a formidable alliance and get a good number of seats along with the regional parties. He enjoys the trust of the national leaders too,” said the source.\\n\\nLike him, Sunil Deodhar is known as a shrewd strategist. He was assigned tasks in difficult political situations on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s instructions and proved his mettle, point out senior BJP leaders. Deodhar was in-charge of Modi’s Varanasi constituency in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and was later assigned to Tripura where the BJP won the assembly election.\\n\\nThough many consider this a regular exercise, the need to replace Muralidhar Rao is being considered as, under his guidance, the party failed to make gains in Tamil Nadu and did not witness much growth.\\n\\n“He failed to instill confidence among the party functionaries in the past eight years. The replacement will be a welcome move,” said a state leader, preferring anonymity. Citing the 2016 assembly election as an example, he added that the party went alone and many BJP candidates polled less than even NOTA. “Again in 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the Centre assigned the task of holding seat sharing talks with allies to Piyush Goyal and C T Ravi. Rao was kept out of it,” he said.

In a first-ofits-kind study of community-based metabolic syndrome disorder — lifestyle diseases — among tribals, Delhi University anthropologists studied Kukana tribals of Valsad to flag an emerging public health issue among tribals as they urbanize. The study was published in Elsevier’s Journal of diabetes and metabolic syndrome published in June this year.The study monitored the health of 296 young tribal boys (128) and girls (168) for almost a year beginning 2018. Overall prevalence of all three metabolic syndrome parameters was found at 3.8% in the group. Gender wise, the prevalence was 3.9% and 3.6% in boys and girls respectively.When individual parameters were considered, low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) or good cholesterol was the most prevalent individual risk factor observed at 64.9% in the study.This is significant as HDL levels are elevated if regular exercise is part of daily life which indicates that like their urban counterparts, tribal teens may be becoming more sedentary. Similarly, prevalence of high blood pressure was higher in males (20.3%) than females (14.3%).Furthermore, fasting blood sugar was prevalent in 10% males and 10% females. Both central obesity and hyperglyceridemia was found more in females. Central obesity was present in 8.6% of males and 10.7% females., while hypertriglyceridemia was found in 11% females as compared to 8.6% males.The study population was taken from two villages — Barumal and Sidhumbar — and two towns of Udvada and Asura in Valsad district. The researchers, doctoral fellow Nupur Mahajan, and retired professor Gautam Kshatriya of the department of anthropology at University of Delhi, said that they had noticed children enjoyed eating cheap and oily processed packaged snacks which were available at stalls put up outside schools. Traditionally, the tribal food basket includes cereals like jowar, nagli, wal, rice, and tuwar. The blood parameters were measured as per the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP)-Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III guidelines.Another interesting observation made by Mahajan was that at least 51% children measured for at least one of the three risk factors for metabolic syndrome disorder, 17.6% teenage children had measured for two risk factors while 3.7% measured for all three risk factors. Kukanas are typically agriculturalist, but due to limitation of land resources they often engage in agricultural labour, daily wage and casual labour work.',\n",

The exports will outpace domestic market growth, which is expected to be 5-6% as compared to 10% in financial year 2020. As a result, overall growth of the pharmaceutical sector in India is likely to be 8-9%, which will be 1.5% lower than the previous year.\\n\\n“Higher exports should offset some of the reduction in domestic formulation sales because of pandemic-led disruptions, especially in the acute therapies segment,” said Tanvi Shah, associate director, CRISIL Ratings.\\n\\nThe report further added that the operating profitability for 350 CRISIL-rated pharmaceutical companies, representing 70% of sector revenue, would soften a bit but remain healthy at 19% despite higher input prices. Credit profiles will continue to be supported by healthy balance sheets.\\n\\nThe export pie is divided into regulated markets such as the US and Europe (45% share in exports), rest of world (ROW) markets (35%) and bulk drugs (20%). “Exports growth is expected to remain strong at 10% and above in each of the segments,” the agency added.\\n\\nStating that India accounted for almost half of the new drug applications approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) since 2019, Isha Chaudhary, director, Crisil Research, added, “This strong pipeline, coupled with lower import alerts and warning letters in recent months, should ensure a steady pace of new launches, which will help sustain export momentum to regulated markets.”\\n\\n',\n",

The equity Series B round was led by global funds, including Aquiline Technology Growth (ATG), RTP Global and Sequoia India , along with Korea and Japan-based investors. Kacker talks to TOI about the path ahead. Excerpts:\\n\\nHow is the company planning for scale growth post the lockdown stage ?\\n\\nSince the pandemic induced lockdown was imposed, we’ve hired and increased our team strength across various functions. We initially focused on increased risk management, balance sheet protection, and building out new initiatives that would set us up for growth, post lockdown. Our underwriting and collections capabilities got battle-tested during the lockdown. The company's tech and data intensity allowed us to serve customers in a smarter, more efficient manner. All of this, combined with a smart and unique capital strategy plus diversified banking partnerships, gave us the confidence of recovery and growth. We are now positioned well for scaling up the business in a post-lockdown world.\\n\\nWhat are the plans to overcome the slowdown?\\n\\nPre-COVID we were doing Rs 2,500 crore per year disbursement, and growing 4x year on year. Owing to consumer sentiments around an economic slowdown, this came down, but then we are back to doing over 60% of our pre-COVID numbers and soon we expect to be at 100% by the festive season at the end of this year. Thereafter, it’s going to be a strong growth trajectory, fuelled by everything that we’ve built out in the past six to nine months, combined with a strong balance sheet.\\n\\nWe’re focused on serving our customers and in enhancing the product offerings so that we can add more value to people’s financial lives according to their needs. There are a lot of exciting innovations in the pipeline in areas of data science, engineering, operations and customer experience management, which will enable us to foster growth and go after an increased market share.\\n\\nWe are also venturing into new lending categories and strategic partnerships to cater to newer segments with consumer financing, 0% interest EMIs, small-ticket personal loans, etc.\\n\\nWhy are you venturing into use-case based lending? Any particular customer feedback that led you towards the same?\\n\\nOn one hand, our customers want affordable instant EMI options , especially for high-value use cases such as education, healthcare and auto purchase. The need for affordable EMI is higher in a post-COVID hit world as households are going through income shock.\\n\\nOn the other hand, merchants want to increase their sales conversions as they see affordability as a key lever for driving sales. Hence, this was the perfect time to launch a category like use case lending - our customers were already taking flexible cash from MoneyTap credit line for a few specific use cases like education, healthcare and auto purchase.\\n\\nHow is the electric vehicle segment as a potential lending category?\\n\\nIndia’s EV potential is estimated to be an Rs 500 billion opportunity by 2025 (basis current EV penetration). From a customer standpoint, EVs offer low operating expenses but have a high initial cost, and that's where new-age fintech players have the opportunity to capture the market early on by offering affordable solutions like 0% EMI. We've recently launched this category with BGauss and will be adding new partners in the category soon.\\n\\nWhat do you think is the market potential in the next two years?\\n\\nThe household debt to GDP is still very low in India (~10%). Credit cards are very under-penetrated and very costly in case you can't pay back or need cash. Post moratorium, lending needs to be central to the recovery, across the board (SME, MSME, consumer lending). We are well-positioned to ride through this storm, having recently raised funds. We have enough runway, strategic tie-ups with capital partners who are ready to lend and confident that our credit line product works.\\n\\n\",\n",

Almost all had complaints against their treatment, with some saying they were cheated, threatened, held against their will or forced to work off unsurmountable debts. Others said they were regularly harassed by authorities, swept up in raids and detained in crowded government facilities.\\n\\nThey included members of Myanmar \\'s long-persecuted Rohingya Muslim minority, who fled ethnic cleansing in their homeland only to be sold into the palm oil industry. Fishermen who escaped years of slavery on boats also described coming ashore in search of help, only to be trafficked onto plantations -- sometimes with police involvement. They said they worked for little or no pay and were trapped for years.\\n\\nThe AP used the most recently published data from producers, traders and buyers of the world\\'s most-consumed vegetable oil, as well as US Customs records, to link the labourers\\' palm oil and its derivatives from the mills that process it to the supply chains of top Western companies like the makers of Oreo cookies, Lysol cleaners and some of Hershey\\'s chocolatey treats.\\n\\nAP reporters witnessed some abuses firsthand and reviewed police reports, complaints made to labour unions, videos and photos smuggled out of plantations and local media stories to corroborate accounts wherever possible. In some cases, reporters tracked down people who helped enslaved workers escape. More than a hundred rights advocates, academics, clergy members, activists and government officials also were interviewed.\\n\\nThough labour issues have largely been ignored, the punishing effects of palm oil on the environment have been decried for years. Still, giant Western financial institutions like JPMorgan Chase, Deutsche Bank and the Vanguard Group have continued to help fuel a crop that has exploded globally, soaring from just 5 million tons in 1999 to 72 million tons today, according to the US Department of Agriculture.\\n\\nSometimes they invest directly but, increasingly, third parties are used like Malaysia-based Malayan Banking Berhad, or Maybank, one of the world\\'s biggest palm oil financiers. It not only provides capital to growers but, in some cases, processes the plantations\\' payrolls, with arbitrary and inconsistent wage deductions that are considered indicators of forced labour.\\n\\n\"This has been the industry\\'s hidden secret for decades,\" said Gemma Tillack of the US-based Rainforest Action Network, which has exposed labour abuses on palm oil plantations. \"The buck stops with the banks. It is their funding that makes this system of exploitation possible.\"\\n\\nThe AP found widespread labour abuses on plantations big and small, including some that meet certification standards set by the global Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, an association that promotes ethical production - including labour practices -- and whose members include growers, buyers, traders and environmental watchdogs.\\n\\nSome of the same companies that display the RSPO\\'s green palm logo signifying its seal of approval have been accused of continuing to grab land from indigenous people and destroying virgin rainforests that are home to orangutans and other critically endangered species.\\n\\nAs global demand for palm oil surges, plantations are struggling to find enough labourers, frequently relying on brokers who prey on the most at-risk people. Many foreign workers end up fleeced by a syndicate of recruiters and corrupt officials and often are unable to speak the local language, rendering them especially susceptible to trafficking and other abuses.\\n\\nThey sometimes pay up to $5,000 just to get their jobs - an amount that could take years to earn in their home countries _ often showing up for work already crushed by debt. Many have their passports seized by company officials to keep them from running away, which the United\\n\\nNations recognizes as a potential flag of forced labour.\\n\\nCountless others remain off the books, including migrants working without documentation and children who AP reporters witnessed squatting in the fields like crabs, picking up loose fruit alongside their parents. Many women also work for free or on a day-to-day basis, earning the equivalent of as little as $2 a day, sometimes for decades.\\n\\nThe AP talked to some female workers who said they were sexually harassed and even raped in the fields, including some minors.\\n\\nThe workers AP interviewed came from Indonesia, Malaysia, Bangladesh, India, Nepal, the Philippines and Cambodia, along with Myanmar, which represents the newest army of exploited labourers. The AP is not fully identifying them or their plantations to protect their safety.\\n\\n\"We work until we are dying,\" said one worker sitting in a room with two other colleagues at a Malaysian plantation run by Felda, a government-owned company. Their eyes filled with tears after learning Felda was one of the world\\'s largest palm oil producers.\\n\\n\"They use this palm oil to make all these products,\" he said. \"It makes us very sad.\"\\n\\nThe Malaysian government was contacted by the AP repeatedly over the course of a week, but issued no comment. Felda also did not respond, but its commercial arm, FGV Holdings Berhad, said it had been working to address workers\\' complaints, including making improvements in recruitment practices and ensuring that foreign labourers have access to their passports.\\n\\nNageeb Wahab, head of the Malaysian Palm Oil Association, a government-supported umbrella group, called the allegations against the industry unwarranted: \"All of them are not true,\" he said.\\n\\nThe Indonesian Palm Oil Association said it has been striving to improve labour conditions for the last five years. Soes Hindharno, spokesman for the country\\'s Ministry of Manpower and Transmigration, said any company violating government rules and regulations on serious issues like child labour and not paying women workers could face sanctions, including having their operations shut down.\\n\\nUnilever, L\\'Oreal, Nestle and Procter & Gamble all said they do not tolerate human rights abuses and investigate allegations raised about companies that feed into their supply chains, taking appropriate action when warranted, which can include working with suppliers to improve conditions or suspending relationships when grievances are not properly addressed.\\n\\nDeutsche Bank reiterated its support of human rights, Vanguard said it monitors companies in its portfolio for abuses, and JPMorgan Chase declined comment.\\n\\nMaybank expressed surprise at the criticism of its standards, saying that \"we reject any insinuation that Maybank may be involved in any unethical behavior.\"\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'US President Donald Trump (File photo)\\n\\nWASHINGTON: The Trump administration on Thursday proposed a fixed time limit on visas of students, researchers and foreign journalists in the United States, noting that it is concerned about the liberal existing visa programme being abused and a potential for increased risk to national security.\\n\\nThe proposal scheduled to be notified in the Federal Register on Friday is not country-specific, but has been brought in view of the abuse of the existing loopholes in the system by China. In all the three categories of foreign students, researchers and journalists, those from China have benefitted the most.\\n\\nUnder the proposed rule, \\'F\\' (students visa) or \\'J\\' (researchers visa) nonimmigrants would be admitted into the US for a period up to the end date of their programme, not to exceed four years.\\n\\nForeign nationals from countries associated with high visa overstay rates (rates greater than 10 per cent for student and exchange visitors) will be limited to up to a two-year fixed period of stay to increase monitoring, deter immigration violations and incentivise a timely departure, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said.\\n\\nAmending the relevant regulations is critical in improving the programme oversight mechanisms, preventing foreign adversaries from exploiting the country\\'s education environment and properly enforcing and strengthening the US immigration laws, Senior Official Performing the Duties of the Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli said.\\n\\nThe duration of stay can be reduced to a maximum of two years of authorised stay in the US if the foreign national is either born or has the citizenship of a country that is on the State Sponsors of Terrorism list.\\n\\nSeparately, the DHS has proposed initially admitting most \\'I\\' nonimmigrants for a period of time necessary to complete the planned activities or assignments consistent with the \\'I\\' classification, not to exceed 240 days. They can be given another extension for a maximum of 240 days, based on the length of the relevant activities. As of now, foreign journalists on \\'I\\' visas have remained in the US for many a times for decades.\\n\\nForeign students would now get just 30 days, instead of the existing 60 days, to leave the country, the DHS said. The stakeholders have been given 30 days\\' time to respond to the notification.\\n\\nIn 2019 alone, there were over 10 lakh admissions in the \\'F\\' status, a dramatic rise from the 263,938 admissions in the \\'F\\' status when the legacy Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) shifted to an unspecified duration of status or D/S admission in 1978.\\n\\nA similar growth in the \\'J\\' population has also occurred over the past decades. In 2018, there were 611,373 admissions in the \\'J\\' status, up by over 300 per cent from the 141,213 \\'J\\' admissions into the US in 1985.\\n\\nFinally, there were 44,140 admissions for foreign media representatives in the US in 2018, a growth of over 160 per cent from the 16,753 admissions into the country in 1985.\\n\\nStudying and participating in exchange visitor and academic programmes in the US offer foreign nationals an access to world-renowned faculty, cutting-edge resources, state-of-the-art courses and individualised instructional programmes, the federal notification said.\\n\\nSimilarly, the US fosters an environment that promotes the exchange of ideas and encourages open discussions when there are differences of opinions, which the country also encourages by allowing foreign news and media members the same unimpeded access and opportunity to share in the constitutional freedoms of the press as domestic news and media members.\\n\\nHowever, the DHS said the significant increase in the volume of \\'F\\' academic students, \\'J\\' exchange visitors and \\'I\\' foreign information media representatives poses a challenge to its ability to monitor and oversee these categories of nonimmigrants while they are in the US.\\n\\nDuring the length of their stay for D/S, a period of admission without a specified end date, these nonimmigrants are not required to have a direct interaction with the DHS except for a few limited instances such as when applying for employment authorisation for optional practical training or for reinstatement if they have failed to maintain the status.\\n\\nAn admission for D/S, in general, does not afford immigration officers enough predetermined opportunities to directly verify that the aliens granted such nonimmigrant statuses are engaging only in those activities that their respective classifications authorise while they are in the US. In turn, this has undermined the DHS\\'s ability to effectively enforce compliance with the statutory inadmissibility grounds related to unlawful presence and created incentives for fraud and abuse.\\n\\nThe DHS said it anticipates that many \\'F\\', \\'J\\' and \\'I\\' nonimmigrants would be able to complete their activities within their periods of admission. However, those who could not generally would be able to request an extension to their period of admission to an immigration officer.\\n\\nIn addition, as proposed, certain categories of foreign nationals would be eligible for shorter periods of admission, based on national security, fraud or overstay concerns, but like all foreigners with fixed admission periods, would have a specific date upon which they would be required to depart the US or would need to apply to the DHS to have their continued eligibility for the \\'F\\', \\'J\\' or \\'I\\' status reviewed by immigration officers.\\n\\nThe DHS believes that this process would help mitigate the risks posed by foreign adversaries who seek to exploit these programmes, said the notification running into 256 pages. Replacing admissions for D/S with admissions for a fixed period of authorised stay is consistent with most other nonimmigrant categories, it added.\\n\\nThe notification said the D/S framework, because it reduces opportunities for a direct vetting of foreign academic students by immigration officers, creates opportunities for foreign adversaries to exploit the F-1 programme and undermine US national security.\\n\\nAn open education environment in the US offers enormous benefits, but it also places research universities and the nation at the risk of economic, academic or military espionage by foreign students.\\n\\n\"Foreign adversaries are using progressively sophisticated and resourceful methods to exploit the US educational environment, including well-documented cases of espionage through the student program,\" it said.\\n\\nDetecting and deterring emerging threats to US national security posed by adversaries exploiting the F-1 programme requires additional oversight, the notification asserted. Same is the case with research scholars under \\'J\\' visas as well, it said.\\n\\n',\n",

Zhong is now Asia’s second-richest person, behind India’s Mukesh Ambani, and is the 17th wealthiest in the world, ahead of Charles Koch and Phil Knight.Nicknamed “Lone Wolf” for his eschewing of politics and clubby business groups, Zhong’s fortune has jumped $51.9 billion in 2020, more than anyone else in the world except Amazon.com Inc’s Jeff Bezos and Tesla Inc’s Elon Musk. Both suffered heavy declines on Wednesday as tech stocks stumbled and Tesla plunged after its “Battery Day” event fell short of expectations. Musk’s fortune dropped by almost $10 billion.The initial public offering of bottled-water company Nongfu Spring Co -- which turned out to be Hong Kong’s most popular among retail investors -- propelled Zhong to China’s top three richest earlier this month. That came after the April listing of vaccine maker Beijing Wantai Biological Pharmacy Enterprise Co pushed his net worth to $20 billion by early August.Zhong now leads a wealth ranking in China that is typically dominated by people who made their fortunes from tech companies.While Zhong has surpassed Ma as China’s wealthiest, the tech tycoon might soon regain the top spot, which he’s held for most of the past six years after Alibaba went public in the US.

Now, as he closes in on a decision on her likely replacement, Trump has used the vacancy to appeal to battleground-state voters and as a rallying cry for his conservative base.\\n\\nHe also is increasingly embracing the high court — which he will have had an outsized hand in reshaping – as an insurance policy in a close election.\\n\\nIncreases in mail, absentee and early voting brought about by the pandemic have already brought about a flurry of election litigation, and both Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden have assembled armies of lawyers to continue the fight once vote-counting begins. Trump has been open about tying his push to name a third justice to the court to a potentially drawn-out court fight to determine who will be sworn in on January 20, 2021.\\n\\n\"I think this will end up in the Supreme Court,\" Trump said on Wednesday of the election, adding, \"And I think it\\'s very important that we have nine justices.\" It\\'s a line echoed by Trump allies, including Texas senator Ted Cruz, who said on Thursday, \"I think that threat to challenge the election is one of the real reasons why it is so important that we confirm the Supreme Court nominees, so that there\\'s a full Supreme Court on the bench to resolve any election challenge.\"\\n\\nBarely six weeks from Election Day, and as millions of Americans are already voting, Trump and his advisers have tried to use the court vacancy to help deliver Trump another term in office.\\n\\nSupreme Court nominations are never entirely devoid of political considerations, but Trump\\'s decision has been particularly wrapped up in a charged political moment.\\n\\nWithin hours of Ginsburg\\'s death, Trump made clear his intention to nominate a woman in her stead, after previously putting two men on the court and as he struggles to mitigate an erosion in support among suburban women.\\n\\nIn discussing his five-person short list, he\\'s been sure to highlight some from election battlegrounds that he\\'s aiming to win this fall as much as their jurisprudence.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve heard incredible things about her,\" he said of Florida\\'s Barbara Lagoa, a day after Ginsburg\\'s death. \"I don\\'t know her.

The appellate court judge was confirmed last year by the Senate in a bipartisan vote and has been promoted for the court by GOP governor Ron DeSantis and others as a nominee with more across-the-board appeal.\\n\\nTrump and his aides, though, appear to have set their sights on nominating judge Amy Coney Barrett of Indiana, who was at the White House twice this week, including for a Monday meeting with Trump.\\n\\nThe staunch conservative\\'s 2017 confirmation on a party-line vote included allegations that Democrats were attacking her Catholic faith. Trump allies see that as a political windfall for them should Democrats attempt to do so once again. Catholic voters in Pennsylvania, in particular, are viewed as a pivotal demographic in the swing state that Democratic nominee Joe Biden is trying to recapture.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, Vice President Mike Pence defended Barrett when asked whether her affiliation with People of Praise, a charismatic Christian community, would complicate her ability to serve on the high court.\\n\\n\"I must tell you the intolerance expressed during her last confirmation about her Catholic faith I really think was a disservice to the process and a disappointment to millions of Americans,\" he told ABC News.\\n\\nTrump played up the power to make judicial nominations with conservative voters in 2016, when Republicans senators kept open the seat vacated by the death of justice Antonin Scalia rather than let President Barack Obama fill the opening. Trump\\'s decision to release lists of accomplished conservative jurists for potential elevation to the high court was rewarded by increased enthusiasm among white evangelical voters, many of whom had been resistant to supporting the candidacy of the one-time New York Democrat.\\n\\nEven before Ginsburg\\'s death, Trump had done the same in 2020, releasing an additional 20 names he would consider for the court, and encouraging Democrat Joe Biden to do the same.\\n\\nBiden has resisted that pressure so far, but that hasn\\'t stopped Trump from trying to sow fear among conservatives about whom the Democrat might nominate. \"So they don\\'t want to show the judges because the only ones that he can put in are far-left radicals,\" Trump said this week.\\n\\n\"If Joe Biden and the Democrats take power, they will pack the Supreme Court with far-left radicals who will unilaterally transform American society far beyond recognition,\" Trump said at a rally outside Toledo on Monday. \"They will mutilate the law, disfigure the Constitution and impose a socialist vision from the bench that could never pass at the ballot box.\"\\n\\n',\n",

During the meeting, it was also agreed, on opposition’s insistence, to take up the issue for discussion and legislation after the election for GB’s ‘legislative assembly’, which Pakistan has scheduled on November 15.\\n\\nSince GB is a disputed region, some political observers believe that Islamabad needs to seek consent of the local population before any decision on their future. “They should be given a choice on what they stand for. Pakistani politicians should not impose a decision on future of GB’s residents without their consent,” said analyst Nazrul Islam. “The upcoming November election is significant in this regard. It remains to be seen whether the political parties will contest election on slogans of merging the land as the fifth province of Pakistan or other issues. More important would be the reaction of people - how they respond to any such call,” Islam added.\\n\\nSome local politicians from GB who are against the idea of merger argue that it will severely damage Pakistan’s Kashmir cause.\\n\\nNawaz Khan Naji, who remained a member of GB’s ‘legislative assembly’ for nine years, was one of the strongest opponents of GB’s merger with Pakistan. “For seven decades, Pakistan had considered it as a disputed territory. It is not only in Pakistan’s interest but GB’s as well to give the region more autonomy instead of making it a province,” Naji said.\\n\\nHe said that Pakistan was doing it on China’s behest. “The China factor has complicated the situation for Pakistan. The Sino-US animosity has made the GB issue more controversial and the scope of Islamabad’s problems in the region has been widened as it has to now sustain pressure from Beijing ’s rivals too,” Naji added.\\n\\nThe local population is also concerned about their status after the merger. Currently, the GB region enjoys the status of a ‘tax-free zone’ and the ‘local government’ has no power to introduce taxes in the region, while the federal government subsidises wheat and petroleum products for locals. A number of GB residents that TOI spoke to opposed the idea of making their region a province of Pakistan, saying that it will end their exemption from taxes.\\n\\nHowever, Muhammad Ali Khan, another politician from the region, is a staunch proponent of the idea of merger of GB with Pakistan. “From day one, we merged with Pakistan and now the government should declare this region a fifth province of the country,” said Khan, who has served as ‘cabinet minister’ in the region.\\n\\n',\n",

       " 'KABUL: A group of young Afghans - both women and men - is coming together in the country\\'s war-torn capital to practice a mystical Sufi Islamic dance.\\n\\nThe group\\'s founder says she sees their whirling dance, known as Sema, as a way of carving out a space in the country\\'s deeply conservative society , particularly when it comes to expectations about gender discrimination and dancing in mixed groups.\\n\\n\"I just wanted to express myself and my feelings with Sema dance,\" said Fahima Mirzaie, a 24-year-old economist.\\n\\nShe recently danced alongside male members of her troupe at a cultural event hosted in a somewhat incongruous setting - an Italian restaurant in central Kabul. That night, she was the only women from her group dancing, although other women watched and read poetry.\\n\\nAs she spins, one hand reaches toward heaven and the other toward the earth, her white robe flowing, in the familiar image of a so-called \"whirling dervish\" seen across the Middle East and Central Asia. Dancers spin repetitively in prayer, chanting Allah and gaining in speed, seeking to lose themselves in a spiritual trance that they believe unites them with God.\\n\\nBut Afghanistan is not widely accepting of this mystical interpretation, and Sufism as well as dancing and singing were both rejected by the Taliban. Many Afghan women are wary of the Taliban returning to power in some form as part of a future peace deal, recalling the years of oppression under a strict form of Islamic law. But even in today\\'s Afghanistan, women and men dancing together in public is mostly rejected as being against the country\\'s culture, traditions and religious beliefs.\\n\\nMost of the members of Mirzaie\\'s dance group, which features men and women performing in public, are Shiite Muslims. They\\'re a minority in Afghanistan that\\'s been targeted for attacks by the Islamic State group, which considers Shiites - Sufi or otherwise - to be heretics. There are other Sufi dance groups scattered across the country\\'s provinces too, primarily men but some women, who perform in front of mixed audiences.\\n\\nMirzaie says she\\'s unfazed by what people may say about her dancing. As part of the generation that\\'s grown up during Afghanistan\\'s latest war, she\\'s concerned about the violence in her society. She hopes she can change it through Sufism and the poems of Rumi, who\\'s possibly the most well-known Sufi mystic.\\n\\nAfghanistan has been at war for more than four decades, first against the invading Soviet army, then warring mujaheddin groups in a bitter civil war, followed by the repressive Taliban rule and finally the latest war that began after the 2001 U.S.-led coalition invasion that toppled the Taliban government.\\n\\nHer group has also used Sufi dance to help them get through the coronavirus pandemic . During a lockdown earlier this year, Mirzaie closed her center and provided training to her students online.\\n\\nNow, she\\'s back whirling in person. At the Italian restaurant, Abdul Ahad , a civil society activist, said he\\'d been to a few Sufi events in Afghanistan that perform in private, but this was the first time he\\'s seen women doing it.\\n\\nMirzaie\\'s mother Qamar says she\\'s worried for her daughter. \"There\\'s no security and girls are taunted on their way out to work.\"\\n\\nShe says she stays awake at night, waiting until Mirzaie returns home after dancing.\\n\\nMirzaie\\'s father, an ex-colonel in the traffic police, her sister and her mother are among her few supporters.\\n\\nBut despite these concerns, she says she cannot live by someone else\\'s rules.\\n\\n\"I never asked anyone\\'s permission for starting it and I will not need anyone\\'s permission to end it, so I will never stop or surrender to anyone.\"\\n\\n',\n",

       " 'STOCKHOLM: The European Union raised the alarm on Thursday over the coronavirus pandemic , saying it is worse now than at the March peak in several member countries, as governments in Europe and beyond reimpose drastic measures.Israel, which closed schools and imposed restrictions on workplaces and leisure activities last week in a second nationwide lockdown, toughened its rules still further on Thursday.Most workplaces and markets are to be closed and prayer meetings and demonstrations will be severely restricted, as the country battles the world\\'s worst per-capita infection rate.The strict measures imposed during the earlier phase of the epidemic, which has now infected more than 30 million and killed more than 950,000, crippled businesses and helped to plunge the world into recession.On Thursday, the IMF said the economic outlook was brighter now than it had been in June, a spokesman suggesting that some parts of the global economy were \"beginning to turn the corner\".Though he added that the outlook remained \"very challenging\".The economy in the United States, which is battling the world\\'s worst outbreak, also had some rare good news with a 4.8 per cent rise in home sales in August.EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides said in \"some member states, the situation is now even worse than during the peak in March\".The death rate has not returned to the levels seen earlier this year but new infections are soaring once again, prompting the bloc\\'s disease control agency to flag seven countries of \"high concern\".The countries, including Spain and several of the EU\\'s eastern states, have \"an increased proportion of hospitalised and severe cases\" among older people and rising death notification rates.Although France was not among those nations, it has tightened its measures -- closing restaurants, workplaces and gyms as businesses already hammered by the earlier lockdown struggle to stay afloat.Bars in Paris and 10 other cities will be forced to close early and the southern city of Marseille will see restaurants and bars close completely.Local officials have reacted with anger and frustration.Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo said on Thursday she had lodged a formal protest, particularly the closure of gyms.\"How will the fact that we can no longer exercise help us, while sport is an important part of keeping us healthy with strong immune systems,\" she asked.Health experts also warned that governments risked losing the trust of the population.Hagai Levine, an epidemiologist who is part of Israel\\'s anti-coronavirus taskforce, said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \\'s rush to ease the first lockdown caused the current crisis.\"When there is no plan, no logic, the public loses its trust,\" he said.For some, that lack of trust also extends to the rush to get out a vaccine, with nine candidates worldwide currently in final clinical trials.In Russia, a vaccine has already been approved even though full clinical trials have yet to be completed, raising concerns about its safety.On Thursday, Russian cosmonauts set to blast off for the International Space Station (ISS) said it was too early to get the vaccine touted by President Vladimir Putin.\"I\\'d personally say that I would not get vaccinated because I tread very carefully on this issue,\" said Sergei Ryzhikov, the leader of the next expedition to the ISS in October.The rollout of a vaccine is seen as crucial in many walks of life, particularly sport, where those events that are taking place are generally behind closed doors.However, Olympic boss Thomas Bach said the postponed Tokyo Games could take place next year even without a vaccine.\"A number of big sport events have been successfully organised recently,\" he said, pointing for instance to the success of the Tour de France Elsewhere in the world of sport, Swedish striker and AC Milan star Zlatan Ibrahimovic, 38, has tested positive for coronavirus, his club announced on Thursday.',\n",

Eight months after the identification of the disease that appeared in Wuhan in December 2019, the world is on the brink of recording one million deaths.The Sars-CoV-2 virus which causes the illness known as Covid-19 first spread rapidly in China, particularly in the province of Wuhan. In the space of one month, the country recorded one thousand deaths.That initial toll was worse than the total number of deaths caused by earlier acute respiratory syndrome SARS, which circulated in Asia in 2002-2003 and led to 774 fatalities.Countries and territories outside continental China were relatively untouched at that point but the virus was already starting to circulate there.The Philippines registered its first case on February 2 and Hong Kong two days later, followed by Japan and France on February 13 and 14.In February cases soared. By March 11, when the WHO declared the new coronavirus a \"pandemic\", 4,500 deaths had been recorded worldwide, across 30 countries and territories.Two-thirds were still in China but Italy (800 deaths) and Iran (300 deaths) saw cases escalate, with deaths soon following.The number of people dying every day in Europe and the United States rose swiftly up until mid-April, reaching peaks in the second week of more than 4,000 and 2,700 average daily deaths respectively.Today the United States remains the hardest-hit country for deaths, with over 200,000 recorded.On a global scale, the deadliest week was April 13 to 19 when more than 7,460 coronavirus deaths were officially reported every day. By then the total number of deaths worldwide had risen to nearly 170,000, or double the level reported on March 31.Since the start of June, the average number of deaths per day has hovered around 5,000.In June, the epicentre of the pandemic shifted to Latin America and the Caribbean. From July 15 to August 15, recorded deaths in the region did not drop below an average of 2,500 per day.Only then did they start to fall gradually, reaching an average 1,900 deaths per day last week.Brazil became the country with the most deaths in total after the United States (more than 138,000). Taking into account the size of their populations, Peru (958 deaths per one million inhabitants), Bolivia (659), Brazil (650), Chile (644) and Ecuador (630), are among the 10 worst-affected countries worldwide, alongside European countries like Belgium (859) and Spain (661).In Asia, where the toll was lower than 100 deaths per day up until mid-April, fatalities have been steadily increasing. The continent has exceeded 1,000 deaths per day almost continually since July 20 and is today approaching 1,500 (1,407 on average over the last seven days).India has been the worst hit, recording a total of 90,000 deaths (more than 1,100 per day last week).Cases are also rising again in Europe, reinforcing concerns about a possible second wave. New cases on the continent are around 20 percent higher this week than last and deaths are up 28 percent at 614.Fatalities are also increasing again in the Middle East (around 330 last week, up 18 percent on the week before).According to official statistics, Africa has been less affected than other continents: deaths have been falling since August (fewer than 200 per day in mid-September, after a peak of around 400 in early August).In Oceania, meanwhile, the average daily number of deaths has never exceeded two dozen.',\n",

We see in training how good a finisher he is,\" said Guardiola of the 17-year-old.However, the lead lasted just four minutes as Bournemouth\\'s Sam Sturridge spun inside the City box before firing into the far corner.Guardiola introduced the artillery he had on the bench after half-time in Kevin de Bruyne and Raheem Sterling, but it was another first-team regular in Foden who made the breakthrough after Riyad Mahrez\\'s shot came back off the post.City will travel to Burnley in the last 16.Liverpool will face Arsenal twice at Anfield in three days next week after Jurgen Klopp\\'s much-changed side hit Lincoln for seven with Takumi Minamino and Curtis Jones both scoring twice.\"Everybody used the opportunity tonight to show up, that\\'s very important,\" said Klopp.\"Who shows the desire we saw tonight, who shows the attitude we saw tonight, who shows so many things that I like and we want to see when a Liverpool team shows up, then there\\'s a big chance you\\'ll get a lot of games during the season.\"Xherdan Shaqiri opened the floodgates with a brilliant free-kick that clipped the underside of the bar.Minamino curled home to double the Premier League champions\\' lead before Curtis Jones struck twice in four minutes to make it 4-0 before half-time.A minute into the second-half, Minamino had his second, but League One Lincoln responded to get two goals to remember the night by.Tayo Edun finished off a great team move and Lewis Montsma headed home a corner.But Liverpool continued to find the net at the other end as Marko Grujic briefly made it 6-1 before Divock Origi rounded off the scoring.Bertrand Traore marked his Aston Villa debut with a stunning side-foot volley to score his side\\'s second goal in a comfortable 3-0 win at Bristol City.Anwar El Ghazi opened the scoring 11 minutes in before Traore showed why Villa spent £17 million ($21 million) to sign him from Lyon last week with a cute finish from a narrow angle.Another Villa new boy Ollie Watkins then grabbed his first goal for the club 17 minutes from time as Dean Smith\\'s men set up a last 16 clash with Stoke.',\n",

Their last defeat dates back to December, 2019.\"It was an intense game but we deserved to win,\" Flick told reporters. \"We are not yet fully in our rhythm despite our big win (8-0) over Schalke 04 on the weekend.\"But the mentality of the team, especially after going 1-0 down, was sensational. They battled back against very strong opponents and deserved the win.\"Bayern were the better side throughout and missed a bagful of chances through Robert Lewandowski, Benjamin Pavard and Thomas Mueller in the first half,Yet it was Bayern keeper Neuer who kept them in the game first with a one-on-one save against Youssef En-Nesyri to send the game to extra time and then pushing another shot from the Sevilla player onto the post two minutes into extra time.The Spaniards gradually ran out of steam, however, and it was only a matter of time until Bayern scored again.Martinez, who is reportedly close to agreeing to a return to Athletic Bilbao this season, benefited from being given too much space to head in on the rebound.The Spaniard also scored in extra time in Bayern\\'s only previous Super Cup win in 2013.Some 15,000 fans were seated in Budapest\\'s Puskas Arena with the game seen as a test event for the gradual return of fans to European games.\"We all know it is not easy to take right decision,\" Flick said of allowing fans. \"But it felt good to have an atmosphere in the stadium. It felt a bit more like football . I hope all the fans return home healthy.\"The match was held amid a growing second wave of COVID-19, with Hungarian cases at record highs, which had prompted warnings of the possible consequences of mass gatherings such as this game.',\n",

       " '\"A lot of us internationals took our first step into sports like cricket, football and hockey at the ground. If the authorities go ahead with their plan it will prove detrimental in the long run. If an exclusive football arena comes up, what happens to other sports and its athletes? Should they play on the congested streets? Hope the government respects the legacy and utility of the ground and upgrades it in such a way that it continues to be a multi-sport arena.\" Ashish Ballal, hockey Olympian\\n\\nBENGALURU: A bylane off Swami Vivekananda road, near Trinity circle, leads to Murphy Town - one of the oldest suburbs of the Cantonment area. As you make your way through the narrow lanes, a concrete road leads to the Murphy Town ground, also known as the Dr Ambedkar playground.The ground is home to the Murphy Town Football Club and the Primrose Hockey Club , which was established here in 1959.In pre-Covid times, the ground used to be the centre of sports activities. The Primrose Hockey Club players occupied one part of the ground while footballers and cricketers shared space with track and field athletes. Not to forget the senior citizens on their morning or evening stroll.Now, what remains of the ground, once a nursery to many international hockey and football stalwarts like Ashish Ballal and Arumainayagam, is piles of debris and stagnant water.Demolition and groundwork has already begun and if the BBMP has its way, the ground may make way for a 9-a-side football stadium complete with a gallery and commercial establishments on the periphery.The move by the authorities has left the residents of Murphy Town and its neighbourhood heartbroken. While they are not against development, they don\\'t want to be robbed of their playground and lung space. Among those impacted will also be hundreds of government schoolchildren, for whom it is the only playground. The compound wall itself is lined by three government schools which use the facility during their physical education periods and annual sports day.The ground is spread over 7,875 sq metres and the proposed project will see the playing area reduced to 3375 sq meters. The bhoomi puja for the proposed stadium was conducted on September 7.On Wednesday, some of the sporting veterans representing the residents (BBMP ward No. 80), met at the ground to sign a petition to be submitted to the BBMP.\"We are not against development but it should be for the betterment of sports in this area. If the BBMP goes ahead with the project, the children of this area, who mostly belong to the lower socio-economic groups, will be deprived of their playing space. They can\\'t afford to play in private facilities. This is their home and we don\\'t want that to be snatched away from them,\" said a crestfallen Kadirvelu, a former athlete and a senior citizen from the locality.The locals fear that if the space is taken away from budding athletes, the absence of sports may lead them down the path of anti-social activities.\"They don\\'t just learn or play sports on the ground. For example, youngsters who come to our club are also trained in life skills. For them sport is a way of life which keeps them away from unwanted distractions,\" explained Vijay from Primrose Hockey Club.Seasoned hockey coach Edward Brient, who has mentored many state and national players, pointed out that there are no public grounds in the vicinity barring the Gowthamapura football ground which is overcrowded.\"All we want the BBMP is to upgrade facilities like drainage and sanitation. We will be grateful if they can do that much,\" added Brient.In 1982, when there was a proposal to establish the Ulsoor bus depot at the playground, the locals managed to convince the authorities to overturn the decision and are hoping they can do the same this time as well.',\n",

We were all briefed on guidelines to follow once the National Camp would begin so in that sense, resuming activities was smooth.

       " '“I need a break from this relationship,” may not be the best approach for you to ask your partner for some alone time. Amongst hanging out with each other everyday and spending most of the time together, it’s understandable that you would want some ‘me’ time. You can be super happy and in love, yet you might want some time to yourself. That’s perfectly okay.Some partners take this in a stride and even admit that they’ve been wanting to binge-watch a series by themselves or have some alone time. However, others might freak out and start wondering if the relationship is coming to an end. For some, staying away from their partner may rise feelings of rejection or pain. This can be a difficult and tricky situation.But do not fret. We’ve rounded up some interesting ways in which you can convey your view to your partner. This will not only increase the understanding between you both but may leave your partner craving for some alone time as well!Be mindful of what you say. Your tone and choice of words really matter so that your partner doesn’t feel that it’s a threat to the relationship. Thread your words carefully and try being assertive in your approach. Instead of relaying the request from your perspective, try pitching in for your partner too—“the exhaustion at work is too much. Probably we need some time alone to figure out our schedules and clear our mind. This space can only benefit us positively in our professional and personal lives.”You may feel the need to figure out yourself, but your partner may not understand what exactly is alone time. They may feel that this equals to needing a break from emotions as well. You have to put your best foot forward in making them understand that this isn’t the case. With compassion and understanding, say that you need a minute to grasp yourself and you’ll be back to snuggle again.This is quite a sensitive matter that you need to approach with a cool head. Your partner may sulk or get into a bad mood, but you should remain firm in your decision. A relationship works when both the individuals are transparent and can understand each other. Your partner may feel bad, but again, both of you need to maturely handle this situation. Remember: you can take care of your needs and still be considerate towards your partner.Since you’re walking on a tightrope here, you can add a planned date afterwise to ease the current situation. Nothing will make your partner happier than you returning calmer, gleeful and ready to give a 100% into the relationship. A planned candle-night dinner or a movie night marathon is a great way to let your partner know that you’ll be ever-ready to bounce back. This move will definitely strengthen your bond further.Carefully consider these points and convey them to your partner. Fear not because soon after your ‘me’ time you’ll be ready to engage in some ‘we’ time.',\n",

Then it was because they had no money. We have helped with food and rescues during COVID19. It has been a very difficult phase for us rescuing all these lost and confused pets\" she says.As these animals also reach to her at the Pawsitive Farm Sanctuary she runs for rescue and rehabilitation, where she is already taking care of 111 dogs and cats, she voices how the choice rests with humans. \"Animals love selflessly. They forgive, they forget and they live and love like there is no tomorrow. They are free children of God and have been made to remind us of these virtues. They can not protest when their voice is not heard. What we do comes back to us in multifold, be it good or evil. The choice rests with us. I have been blessed to be able to bring them home, to be able to take care of them, to stand up for them\" she adds.After much advocacy, many activists are now reversing the situation by helping find the furry babies a better and forever home with those who would take care of them. \"Change happens because of a few good people.

While the testing is seeing an active response from the public, recent reports have suggested that at least seven participants have been found ineligible for vaccine testing, as the Serum Institute of India began phase III testing at a government facility in Pune.\\n\\nAccording to an agency report, the volunteers in question were disqualified because of medical reasons and would be screened again this week.\\n\\n\"All seven candidates who were selected on Monday have become ineligible due to various medical reasons, including antibody test coming positive for some...Some more candidates have been screened today (Tuesday) and if their results in the antibody and COVID-19 tests are negative and if they are eligible on other medical grounds, they will be administered vaccine candidate..\"\\n\\nIt should be noted that while volunteers, in any trial have the option to opt-out or leave the trial at any time, there are specific guidelines as to who can enrol for the trial, be tested on, followed globally.',\n",
       " 'Drugs known as sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are associated with a lower risk of major heart problems in patients with type 2 diabetes than dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, say, researchers.According to the study, published in the journal The BMJ, previous trials have shown that SGLT2 inhibitors can reduce the risk of heart conditions such as heart attack, stroke, and heart failure compared with placebo.But some of these trials had important limitations, making it difficult to interpret the results, and data on the effects of individual SGLT2 inhibitors on the heart are limited.So the research team from McGill University in Canada set out to compare the risk of cardiovascular events between SGLT2 inhibitors and DPP-4 inhibitors among adults with type 2 diabetes in a \"real world\" clinical practice setting.Their findings are based on healthcare data from seven Canadian provinces and the UK from 2013-18 (a total of 209,867 new users of an SGLT2 inhibitor matched to 209,867 users of a DPP-4 inhibitor).Major cardiovascular events (a combination of heart attack, stroke or cardiovascular death), as well as heart failure and death from any cause, were recorded for an average of 11 months.Compared with DPP-4 inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors were associated with a reduced risk of heart attack, stroke or cardiovascular death combined (11.4 events per 1000 person years vs 16.5 events per 1000 person years).\"SGLT2 inhibitors were also associated with decreased risks of individual events,\" the researchers wrote.According to the researchers, results were similar in subgroups defined by patient age, sex, past insulin use, and history of cardiovascular disease.This is an observational study and the researchers point to some limitations, such as relying on prescription data over a relatively short follow-up period.They cannot rule out the possibility that other unmeasured (confounding) factors may have affected their results. However, results were consistent across several analyses, suggesting that they withstand scrutiny.These findings suggest that SGLT2 inhibitors offer cardioprotective benefits among people with type 2 diabetes in a real-world setting, although additional studies are needed to determine if these benefits persist long term.',\n",
       " 'The UK could be the first country in the world to carry out Covid \\'challenge trials\\', where healthy volunteers would be deliberately infected with coronavirus to test possible vaccines, a report said.According to the BBC, the UK government said that it was holding discussions about developing a vaccine through such \"human challenge studies\". No contracts have yet been signed.Alastair Fraser-Urquhart, an 18-year old university student, is planning to volunteer for the trial if it is given the green light to go ahead.\"I think the challenge trial has the potential to save thousands of lives and really bring the world out of the pandemic sooner. It is just something that made instant sense to me,\" AFraser-Urquhart was quoted as saying in the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.Speaking on the same programme, Peter Horby, professor at the Oxford University, said that he thought the trial is a good idea with real potential to advance science and get a better understanding of the disease.Horby said that it is likely that the volunteers would be observed very closely and their immune systems would be monitored to see how they respond to the virus.There are -- perhaps surprisingly -- lots of young and healthy people ready to volunteer for the coronavirus challenge trials. It would be a way of finding out, almost immediately, whether a vaccine works. And it could help speed the selection of the promising coronavirus vaccines.According to the report, the health of the volunteers would be monitored round the clock at a clinical research facility in London.',\n",

       " \"Dean Jones, one of the finest batsmen and a great commentator, passed away due to a massive cardiac arrest in Mumbai yesterday. Dean Jones’s double century in Chennai during the 1986 tied Test match is still a talking point among cricket fans. In a chat with us, former Indian captain Krishnamachari Srikkanth, who was part of the Test match, and Suhail Chandok, who has hosted many shows with the late cricketer, fondly remember the Australian cricketer.Recalling his memories of Dean Jones, Srikkanth said, “It’s very shocking. I don’t know what to say. I’ve played a lot of cricket with him. He was an extraordinary batsman who scored runs in all kinds of wickets across the world.” He added, “I can never forget that double century in the Madras Test in 1986. He really couldn’t bear the September heat of Madras. In spite of that, he continued to bat, drinking water, and got a brilliant double hundred. I can only say my condolences to his family members and may his soul rest in peace.”Dean Jones , who shared the nuances of the game with his fans, used to be called Professor Deano for his analytical skills. Srikkanth said, “He knew the game very well, he was a good reader of the game.”Television presenter Suhail Chandhok, who had presented several shows with Dean Jones said, “We’re wrecked and I’m truly gutted. It’s hard to process it. To me, he was a legend. But more than anything, he was a friend. I’ve probably done nearly 70 percent of my broadcasts with him, including his last show, which he had lit it up as ever. We used to talk about golf, life, family and cricket. He was a legend in his own right. He changed the game in many ways in ODI cricket. He brought life to every room he went to. He lit up each room, he lit up each show and he lived life to the fullest. It’s a privilege to have learnt from him, to have worked with him, commentated alongside him and been together on and off the field as friends. It’s a shock to all of us and my thoughts are with Jane (his wife) and his kids. I can't imagine what they’re going through.”\",\n",
       " '“It’s a breezy ride through all of humankind’s big failures, with the perspective of how those failures have led to huge discoveries and growth that impact our life to date,” says playwright Prashanth Nair, while explaining how the plot of The Importance of Failing Fabulously! is apt for times like these. It’s a first-of-its-kind live, interactive, online performance by Bengaluru-based theatre group Tahatto. Prashanth had started writing the play for stage before the pandemic brought the world to a standstill. But mid-way through when the lockdown began and there was a sudden resurgence of the digital space, the playwright and his collaborators, Piyush Agarwal and Badarivishal Kinhal, were quick to adapt the piece for the tiny, rectangular windows on a video platform. Lately, a number of recorded performances have been streamed online, giving performance lovers access to a large repertoire of theatrical gems, but The Importance of Failing Fabulously! goes a notch higher — it enables the audience to interact with the actors. And all of this made possible even as the four cast members — Karun Pahwa, Nithya J Rao, Sannidhi Surop and Oliver E Gibbs — rehearsed and acted in the play from their respective homes.“The idea behind this process was also to invite the audience to come and watch a performance in a manner that they have never done before. Luckily, people responded to us with a sense of curiosity, wondering how the play is going to replicate the aspect of ‘nowness’ between the performers and the audience. At various stages of the play, the audiences are asked questions, the responses to which impact the plot accordingly, making it an interactive experience and not just a passive watch. Although we cannot see the audiences’ expressions and how they are reacting to things, through this format, there has been some sense of reaching out via the screen,” explains Prashanth.',\n",

       " 'Poles were left shaken and stirred by news that a suspected British agent called James Bond was on Her Majesty’s secret service in the country in the 1960s, after the Institute of National Remembrance (IPN) posted about him on social media.According to the institute’s archive James Bond came to Poland on Feb. 18, 1964 and was officially employed as an archivist for the British Embassy Military Attache. He soon came to the attention of Polish counter-intelligence officers.“We know he was in Poland ... in 1964 and 1965,” Marzena Kruk, director of the IPN’s archive, told Reuters.“He travelled a bit around Poland ... he liked women, the same as his literary namesake, but there is not even a word about Martini,” she said, referring to the fictional character’s favourite tipple. “However, there is information that he liked Polish beer.”Bond was under strict surveillance, and visited the Bialystok and Olsztyn regions of northeastern Poland to try and “penetrate military facilities” in the Soviet satellite state, according to the files.However, he was found not to have made contacts with Polish citizens, which would have had serious consequences for any Poles suspected of working with agents from the other side of the Iron Curtain.The British agent 007 created by author Ian Fleming hit the silver screen in 1962 when actor Sean Connery played the character in the film “Dr. No”, leading some to suspect British spies may have been playing a joke on their Polish counterparts with their choice of pseudonym.“Maybe it was a bit of fun with Polish counter-intelligence, maybe he had a sense of humour,” Kruk said.',\n",

       " 'Since the coronavirus pandemic hit the world eight months ago, people have been more cautious than ever. Be it washing their hands or sanitizing the groceries, necessary precautions are taken by one and all. When it comes to sanitizing homes, you might clean the door knobs and kitchen on a daily basis to keep the virus at bay. But have you thought about how often you should clean your bathroom, which is the most used part of your home these days? Read on to read about the right way to disinfect toilets and keep your bathroom squeaky clean.Since all of us are frequently washing hands these days, the bathroom has probably become the most visited room in the house. While it is best if everyone in the family has a separate toilet, to maintain optimum hygiene, you can follow the below given tips if you share the bathroom with other family members.As a part of toilet hygiene, you must always wipe the seat after using it. Keep a toilet paper roll handy and use a dab of disinfectant to clean the seat after usage. This will not only make the washroom look more presentable to the next person who uses it but will also keep the hygiene factor high.Wash basin usage has increased considerably in the past few months as everyone is home and has resorted to cleaning their hands, thanks to the pandemic. With most people working from home, the wash basins are used more than before. While you might sanitize your hands by washing them for 20 seconds with soap and water; how sanitized is the tap which is touched every time you are done washing the hands? In order to keep the basin area clean, make sure you disinfect the taps from time to time. It is best to close the tap using your wrist or elbow after you are done washing your hands. Usually, the taps should ideally be disinfected at least 2-3 times during the day.Disinfect the door knobs, bathroom seat, wash basin and taps on a daily basis with soap water. Be cautious while using the toilet and always leave it sanitised for the next person. If anyone in your family is sick or is experiencing symptoms, it is best to isolate them and make them use a separate bathroom.You need not panic-clean as it won’t help in any manner. Direct every individual in the family to maintain optimum hygiene and follow the sanitization protocol properly to keep the bathroom neat and tidy.',\n",
       " \"Nothing livens up a dish like fresh herbs, which is why you should always have some on hand. And the best way to do that? Grow them right inside your own home. Whether you just want some fresh basil or you're looking to grow a whole host of herbs—and whether or not you're known for your green thumb—there are plenty of gorgeous indoor planters and gardens that can make your dream a reality.There are so many varieties for a mixture of looks in the garden. You can find basil with dark purple leaves, large green leaves, and small, fine-cut leaves that make them valuable additions to the landscape. If you don’t always pinch off the blooms, you’ll have pretty flowers also, although pinching them off will make the flavor in the leaves stronger.Basil is an amazing herb to use – especially when you can get it fresh from the garden. A favorite classic basil dish is homemade pesto. It’s a must in almost every Italian dish and adds a really fresh flavor to salads, tomatoes, omelets, stir-fry dishes, and more.Sage is another great herb that belongs in every herb garden. Sage is a drought-tolerant plant, which makes it good for growing in containers or raised beds. Because it is a perennial, it will often survive for a couple years in the home garden. I love that sage is available in colored and variegated forms, making it an eye-catching accent in the garden, and the textured leaves are always attractive.No herb garden conversation is complete without a mention of delicious and easy-to-grow mint. Mint is so easy to grow, in fact, that it will often spread through the semi-shade areas of the garden. If you want it to stay in one place, I recommend growing mint in containers.Another great herb is chives. You can harvest chives as needed throughout the entire growing season. They are easy to grow because you can either start the plants from seed or get clumps of divided plants from fellow gardeners. They aren’t fussy in the garden as long as they don’t get too hot.Coriander enjoys a sunny position but appreciates a little shade during the hottest part of the day. Plants will run to seed more quickly if stressed by hot weather so this is important for leaf varietiesYou can also grow coriander successfully in pots or trays filled with a good multipurpose compost. Coriander plants have deep tap roots so pots need to be at least 25cm deep. Scatter seeds on the surface of the compost and cover, watering well. In a pot of 25cm diameter you can sow approx 5 seeds per pot.\",\n",

      "Headline before vectorization: MUMBAI: The city has witnessed its second wettest monsoon in recorded history. With the India Meteorological Department’s Santacruz observatory, representative of Mumbai, recording 395.1mm rainfall in the 48 hours ending Thursday morning, this year’s total seasonal rain of 3,679.8mm beat 2019’s tally of 3,670.4mm.The highest seasonal (June 1 to September 30) rainfall for the city is 3,759.7mm, recorded in 1958. This year, with a week to go for monsoon to be officially over, the total is nearly 80mm short of the record.This monsoon, the Colaba observatory received total rain of 3,198.7mm until 8.30 pm on Thursday, the highest seasonal rain since 1983, when it had recorded 3,329.8mm.As the showers continued well into the night, Santacruz recorded 108.7mm rainfall in the 24 hours ending 8.30am on Thursday. Colaba recorded 50.4mm rain in the same period. But as Mumbaikars woke up to clear skies and sunshine on Thursday, the IMD Santacruz station recorded just 0.5mm rainfall between 8.30am and 5.30pm, while the Colaba station recorded no rainfall.“Areas in Mumbai, Thane and Navi Mumbai received heavy to very heavy rains at isolated places in last 24 hours (Wednesday to Thursday). Rain in the rest of the places was in the range 70-100mm. On Wednesday evening, the intensity was more towards Thane and Navi Mumbai. On Thursday morning, the skies were clear and there was a slight rise in temperatures,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director general, western region, IMD.The IMD has forecast light to moderate rain for Mumbai, Thane, Palghar and Raigad for at least until the end of the week. For Friday, weathermen have forecast cloudy skies with light to moderate rain with a possibility of occasional intense spells of rain in Mumbai.\n",
