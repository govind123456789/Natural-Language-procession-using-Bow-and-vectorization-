"LUCKNOW: The UP government is planning ‘ Operation Durachari ’, to be launched soon for naming and shaming habitual offenders in the cases of crime against women. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath has also instructed the police to strengthen ‘ anti-Romeo squads’ across the state.

Although the modalities and other details of ‘Operation Durachari’ are yet to be finalised, sources in the state home department said that photographs of those found to be habitual offenders in cases of sexual harassment and other crime against women would be put on display at prominent crossings.

It has also been decided that all those involved in crime against women should be handled by women officers only. If there is any criminal incident with a woman, then the respective beat in-charge, outpost incharge, police station in-charge and circle officer would be held responsible.

DGP HC Awasthy also instructed district police chiefs to take strict action in cases of crime against women and strengthen the ‘anti-Romeo squads’. He said that patrolling of UP 112 vehicles should be intensified on places where eveteasing is common and all the police chiefs should make a facility of women help centres in their respective offices. Checking by anti-Romeo squads must be done by cops while wearing body-worn cameras.

"Tejashwi Yadav not acceptable as leader, 'Mahagathbandhan' will break before polls: Ram Kripal Yadav

Speaking to ANI, Ram Kripal Yadav, when asked about cracks in the opposition camp, said that no coalition party of Mahagathbandhan is ready to accept Tejashvi Yadav as its leader. He said that their use and throw attitude towards coalition partners has left the RJD ineffective in the state. ""Mahagathbandhan was founded on selfish interests. RJD is leading the Opposition camp. Neither they have the intelligence not heart to accommodate and run a coalition. RJD has a character of use and throw. They throw those out who are not of use to them.

"When two brothers fell critically ill with

around the same time in March, their doctors were baffled. Both were young -- 29 and 31 years old -- and healthy. Yet within days they couldn’t breathe on their own and, tragically, one of them died.

Two weeks later, when a second pair of Covid-stricken brothers, both in their 20s, also appeared in the Netherlands, geneticists were called in to investigate. What they uncovered was a path leading from severe cases,

, and gender differences to a loss of immune function that may ultimately yield a new approach to treating thousands of

patients.

The common thread in the research is the lack of a substance called

that helps orchestrate the body’s defense against viral pathogens and can be infused to treat conditions such as infectious hepatitis. Now, increasing

suggests that a significant minority of Covid-19 patients get very ill because of an

response. Twin landmark studies published Thursday in the journal Science showed that

interferon may lurk at a dangerous turning point in SARS-CoV-2 infections.

“It looks like this virus has one big trick,” said

, a professor in the Center for Infectious Disease and Vaccine Research at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology in California. “That big trick is to avoid the initial innate immune response for a significant period of time and, in particular, avoid an early type-1 interferon response.”

The work highlights the potential for interferon-based

to enlarge a slowly accumulating range of Covid-19 treatments. These include Gilead Sciences Inc.’s remdesivir and convalescent plasma, a component of the blood of recovered patients that may contain beneficial immune factors.

These treatments provide limited benefit and are typically used in very sick, hospitalized patients. The

that interferon may help some people is enticing because it appears most efficacious in the early stages of infection, when life-threatening respiratory failure could still be averted. Dozens of studies of interferon treatment are now

Covid-19 patients.

“We think timing may be essential because it’s only in the very early phase one can really battle the virus particles and defend against infection,” said

, head of the genomic technologies and immuno-genomics group at Radboud University Medical Center in Nijmegen that analyzed the DNA of the two sets of brothers.

Being male, elderly, and having underlying medical conditions can all raise patients’ risk of life-threatening Covid-19. But even within these groups, disease severity varies widely. Scientists have speculated other factors influence susceptibility, including pre-existing levels of inflammation and immunity, the amount of virus that starts an infection, and patients’

.

New nexus

Interferon’s role represents a new nexus in Covid-19’s complex interaction with the human immune system. Many patients suffer their worst complications because of an immune overreaction sometimes called a cytokine storm, and may benefit from dexamethasone, a cheap generic that calms these storms.

“It’s a very interesting disease because too little immunity is no good,” Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Sept. 10 in an on-line briefing for Massachusetts General Hospital staff. “Too much immunity is really, really bad.”

Whether sufficient interferon is available early or late in Covid-19 cases has a major bearing on disease severity, according to Yuen Kwok-Yung, chair of infectious diseases in the University of Hong Kong’s department of microbiology. Ideally, production of the antiviral substance would be triggered when immune cells encounter SARS-CoV-2 genetic material, stopping rapid viral reproduction inside the body and averting complications, he said.

“But the SARS-CoV-2 virus has anti-interferon genes which can stop or antagonize the production or effect of interferon,” said Yuen, who

in human lung tissue. If the interferon response is delayed and the amount of virus in the body peaks at a high level, other parts of the immune system will be “awakened.”

‘Really disastrous’

That may trigger lung-injuring inflammation -- collateral damage from an excessive immune reaction to the virus. “This is really disastrous,” he said.

Some people are known to have trouble fighting infections because they make antibodies that deactivate their own interferon. On Thursday, a global consortium of researchers said such immune reactions to the protein could account for life-threatening Covid-19 pneumonia in at least 2.6% of women and 12.5% of men.

Interferon-blocking antibodies appeared in 101 of 987 patients with severe disease, but none of 663 people with an asymptomatic or mild case, according to

in Science. Patients over age 65 were also more likely than younger ones to have the autoimmune abnormality, which was “clinically silent until the patients were infected with SARS-CoV-2,” the group of more than 100 scientists said.

‘First explanation’

“These findings provide a first explanation for the excess of men among patients with life-threatening Covid-19 and the increase in risk with age,” the researchers led by

, head of Rockefeller University’s St. Giles Laboratory of Human Genetics of Infectious Diseases in New York said. “They also provide a means of identifying individuals at risk of developing life-threatening Covid-19.”

Those genetic flaws were similar to the ones that Hoischen and his colleagues from a dozen Dutch centers

in the Journal of the American Medical Association two months ago. The two sets of brothers had inherited a gene mutation that impaired the interferon response, keeping their immune systems from fighting the coronavirus until it had replicated for days.

In the Dutch men, the effects were cruel. The first, a young father from a town in the southern Netherlands, suffered shortness of breath, cough and fever at home for eight days before admission to intensive care. He was to spend 33 days in the hospital, 10 of them on a ventilator.

Raging fever

His 29-year-old brother succumbed to Covid-19 in an intensive care unit in Rotterdam, after being treated for shock and a fever that soared to 44 degrees Celsius (111 degrees Fahrenheit). When doctors at Radboud learned of his younger sibling’s case, as well as a second pair -- 21- and 23-year-old brothers also in respiratory failure -- they went looking for a genetic cause.

They found a mutation that was carried on the X chromosome. Defects on this

are more likely to affect men, who have only one copy, while women have two.

The men’s mutations are rare -- occurring in 1 in 10,000 people -- and an unlikely explanation for the vast majority of severe Covid-19 cases. But the studies in Science indicate that various forms of interferon dysfunction may underlie as many as 14% of critical patients, and that screening and targeted treatment might prevent severe illnesses and deaths.

“If we manage to get them into our university medical center early enough,” Hoischen said, “our clinicians may be able to treat them with interferons.”

Other ways of overcoming autoimmunity, like the removal of antibodies against interferon from the blood, called plasmapheresis, could also help patients. On the other hand, patients who produce antibodies against interferon shouldn’t donate blood products for treating other patients.

“The rare diseases and the more common forms of the same disease may converge, and we can learn from each other,” said Hoischen. “That’s the hope.”",Why Covid may be life-threatening for some
"ONE-DAY WONDER: Dean Jones blazes away in country colours in March, 1992 in Australia. (Getty Images)

MUMBAI: Calling him an ""extrovert to the core"", Team India 's head coach Ravi Shastri said he would remember Dean Jones , who died of a sudden, massive cardiac arrest on Thursday, as ""a very good cricketer and commentator"" and ""one of the best One-day players in the world, ever"".Speaking to TOI on Thursday evening, just hours after the former Australian cricketer passed away, Shastri conveyed his condolences. ""Really shocking to lose a colleague and a dear friend. Gone so young. It's very sad that he had to pass away in my city, and at a time when I couldn't even meet him. I'm very sorry for Jane (his wife) and the kids,"" he said.Shastri remembers Jones as a laugh-a-minute colleague, with a very good sense of humour and great fun to work with. ""With him around, there was electricity. All the time I've known him, he was a livewire. I'm 58, he was 59, and I've known him since 1986 - that's almost 35 years. I will never forget him hosting me at his home for the Christmas-day lunch during the 2003-04 India tour of Australia,"" the India coach said.In the mid and late 80s, Shastri said, ""Dean Jones was among the best One-day batsmen in the world, on par with Viv (Richards) and Javed ( Miandad )"".Calling him a ""terrific entertainer"" in white ball cricket during his time, Shastri said, ""He was ahead of his time in the 50-over format, had an attacking style, his running between the wickets was excellent and he was right there at the top.""Shastri and Jones first played Test cricket against each other when India toured Australia in 1985-86 for a three-Test series followed by Australia touring India soon thereafter.""His 210 at Chepauk , battling the heat and humidity, was an exemplary effort. In my opinion, it ranks as the second-best innings ever played by an overseas Test batsman in India, after Kevin Pietersen 's Wankhede innings in 2012,"" Shastri said.",Dean Jones was ahead of his time in ODIs: Shastri

"NEW DELHI: American cult bikemaker Harley-Davidson , often used by US President Donald Trump in trade diplomacy with India, is shutting down its only factory in India on below-par business as it takes a hard call to exit markets where sales continue to remain weak and outlook stands shaky.In its decade-long presence in India, the company has sold over 25,000 units and today has 33 dealerships, which, too, may shut down or be scaled down massively. It is estimated that the move involves $75 million in restructuring costs, and job losses for some 70 remaining employees (it had been reducing manpower over the past few months).Harley, is, however, close to striking a partnership with a homegrown brand, most likely to be Hero MotoCorp of Pawan Munjal, sources told TOI. While refraining to provide details about its future plans, the company said it is ""changing its business model"" in India and ""evaluating options"" to continue to serve its customers.TOI had first reported about Harley’s plans to scale down India business in its edition dated August 6 this year, while also reporting about partnership plans with Hero Moto in the February 19 and September 8 editions.Harley is not the only company to have exited India. Other on the list include General Motors and MAN Trucks, while Ford has also quit solo operations and has joined hands with Mahindra & Mahindra.""Harley-Davidson plans to close its manufacturing facility in Bawal and significantly reduce the size of its sales office in Gurgaon. The company is communicating with its customers in India and will keep them updated on future support,"" the company said in a statement. ""The Harley-Davidson dealer network will continue to serve customers through the contract term.""Harley’s exit comes at a time when the Indian economy and the auto industry are passing through one of their toughest periods ever as coronavirus-induced slowdown and poor consumer demand have depressed sales to historic lows. Also, companies have complained of high duty and tax structure on the automobile industry, and those voicing concern include Maruti Suzuki, Mahindra & Mahindra, Toyota, Hero Moto, Bajaj Auto, and TVS.Even President Trump has often raked up the issue of ""high"" import duty that Harley bikes faced in India (he called it ""unfair""), even taking it up with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Trump’s complaints had led the Centre to reduce the duty on Harley motorcycles from 100% to 50%, though the US government still remained unsatisfied.Harley’s exit from manufacturing in India may be a dampener for India’s trade discussions with the US, as the latter may continue to blame the import duty structure.Harley’s problems, however, were more than just adverse duty structure. In a price-sensitive market, the company failed to bring affordable models (its lowest powered on sale in India is the Street 750cc, priced at Rs 4.7 lakh ex-showroom) in line with the demand of the broader market, despite doing local assembly at Bawal. Its India product portfolio was a mix of locally assembled models (through imported kits), apart from imported bikes.While Harley did manage to create an aura around cruisers and leisure riding, especially through its famed HOG programme (where it had 6,500 members), the move ended up helping local brand Royal Enfield more that saw a massive growth in demand. Led by promoter Siddhartha Lal, Enfield — often seen as ""India’s Harley"" by the middle class — has been on a roll over the past few years and plans to become the world’s biggest mid-engine motorcycle maker across the world.Harley has also been slow in striking a partnership with local players, even though other companies managed to do so. German BMW has partnered TVS Motors for lower-powered bikes, while UK’s Triumph has joined hands with Bajaj Auto.Harley said the India strategy change is happening as part of a new plan called ""The Rewire"", which aims at an overhaul of its operating model and market structure. ""These actions are aligned with 'The Rewire' which is planned to continue through the end of 2020, leading to 'The Hardwire', a new strategic plan for 2021-2025 aimed at building desirability for the Harley-Davidson brand and products,"" its statement said.It is believed that Mahindra & Mahindra and Bajaj Auto also had talks with Harley, though the company prefers Hero Moto. On the questions of a partnership with Harley, Hero chairman Pawan Munjal had earlier told TOI, ""If they want to (enter into a partnership), then why not? Sure... I am open to the right kind of match… The sooner it happens, it's good for everyone.""","Harley shuts India factory, may tie up with Hero"

"The circus’ one-hour show is being streamed by a ticketing platform

Covid has pushed all modes of entertainment online, and the circus is the latest to leave the live stage and perform for the handheld screen. On Friday the 19-year-old Rambo circus, based in Airoli, Mumbai, will become the first in India to go online with an one hour show that will be streamed on Bookmyshow platform. Just like the circus of the past, it will have all the acts — trapeze artistes, jugglers, jokers — but instead of being spontaneous it will be rehearsed, recorded and edited for a short one-hour format.

The artistes are not complaining. Biju Pushkaran, 51, a clown with the circus since its inception, said that things became bad for them during the lockdown. “Many artistes were planning to return to their hometowns and villages but then about two months ago we got this proposal from Laqshya Live Experiences, an event management firm, and Production Crew Entertainment Pvt Ltd. It was godsend. We were so happy to have got a chance to work.”

Usually, a circus takes three to four days to set up — erecting the tent and arena with labour of around 100 people. “For this online project, just 24 of us erected the tent and set up the arena in a day’s time. Such was our enthusiasm,” said Pushkaran. The artistes were trained for the show for 15 days and the shooting finished in another 2-3 days. “I missed the audience and its applause and cheering. But the director asked me to visualise the audience and it helped,” said Pushkaran.

Sujit Dilip, founder of Rambo circus, said that it was a challenge to fit a 2.5-hour-long circus performance into one hour.

Covid has made it difficult for circuses and street performances to survive. A survey by Circostrada Network in Europe found that 94% events have been cancelled and on average per performance 14 jobs are affected. Cirque du Soleil group in Canada filed for bankruptcy protection in July.

But the show must go on, said Dinesh Shetty, founder, Production Crew Entertainment Pvt Ltd. “We are excited to take the age-old circus experience online,” he said.

Green breather: Forest Dept expands the 600 acres in Aarey CM declared forest to 800 acres and links it to Sanjay Gandhi National Park.The Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP), shrinking over the years because of encroachments, will now expand by 800 acres.Just weeks afterproposed to designate 600 acres of land in Aarey Colony as forest, the state government’s Forest Department has not only agreed to add another 200 acres to what the CM sought, but also link the entire land parcel to the neighbouring SGNPWith the additional 800 acres, SGNP will now spread over an area of around 106 sq km, up 3 km from the existing 103 sq km – a gain of almost an entire Central Park in New York.SGNP, one of the few national parks in the world located within a bustling city, is home to over 40 leopards. While SGNP leopards often strayed into Aarey, with the addition of 800 acres, it will become their legitimate stomping ground.Confirming the development, SGNP Director G Mallikarjun said the land will be first taken over from Aarey by the Revenue Department and then declared reserve forest. “The 800 acre is spread over Goregaon village,in revenue records,” he said.A senior cabinet minister said that around 825 acres will be declared as a reserve forest. It will include the Aarey Colony but not the site of the Metro 3 car shed since no formal decision to shift the car shed has been taken so far.Whilehas been pushing for saving Aarey Colony, Forest Minister Sunil Kedar took the lead in connecting it to SGNP.“There will be a process of suggestions and objections. This will take around nine months. There are several tribal hamlets here and the residents have legacy rights over the forest. So, we are expecting around 50 acres to remain outside the reserve forest area,” said the minister.While the previouswas hell bent on building a Metro car shed at Aarey and had ordered cutting of trees in the middle of the night after a favourable court order, Uddhav Thackeray-led MVA is pushing for relocation of the car shed site and preservation of Aarey land as a forest.Principal Secretary, Forest, Milind Mhaiskar, who visited Aarey last week, said a slum rehabilitation site located within Aarey has also been moved out freeing up a large land parcel. “Besides, to have a zoo within Aarey is not a great concept. SGNP is a proper forest and we already have a zoo in Byculla. So, the 100 acres reserved for zoo also comes back,” he said.Mhaiskar said roads within Aarey will be improved and new forest trails will be created. “SGNP’sdensity is highest in the world. We are planning to add a total of 800 acres to SGNP,” he said.",SGNP gets 800 acres from Aarey Colony
"Nerul got a new plasma blood sample collection centre recently

MUMBAI: The state government on Thursday slashed the price of high resolution CT (HRCT) scan for Covid-19 patients by more than half, fixing it between Rs 2,000 and Rs 3,000 depending on the machine’s features. The price of 200 ml plasma unit too has been cut by 25% and capped at Rs 5,500.

The decisions follow complaints from patients of being overcharged or blackmarketing in case of plasma. Dr Sudhakar Shinde, CEO of the State Health Assurance Society, who headed the committee set up to decide on the HRCT price capping, told TOI that “the cost of HRCT has been between Rs5,000 and Rs1,0000 in some five-star hospitals.”

Radiologists performing CT scans for Covid-19 patients will not only have to report on the lungs, but also mention details of other organs. “Doctors were following a short-cut method of only reporting on lungs, but if a patient is undergoing a scan full of radiation, he or she should be told about other organs as well,” said Dr Shinde. The cost of CT (HRCT) scan includes the price of PPE, disinfectants, etc.

HRCT emerged as a key diagnostic tool for Covid-19, while convalescent plasma is being used to treat mild to moderately ill patients.

While a 200 ml unit of plasma extracted using the plasmapherisis method has been capped at Rs5,500 per bag, the average cost in most hospitals in Mumbai is between Rs7,000 and Rs 7,500.

In the early phase of the Covid pandemic, high-resolution CT scan (HRCT) had emerged as a life-saving tool for city doctors. The ‘ground glass’ opacities in the CT scans of the lungs helped doctors decide on the severity of the disease in patients whose tests results were taking days to arrive.

“RT-PCR only has a sensitivity of 70% to diagnose Covid-19, while antigen tests have 50% sensitivity. However, HRCT has over 80% sensitivity,” said Dr Shashank Joshi, who is a member of the state task force on Covid-19. “It is a useful tool to understand the severity of the disease. The capping will make it more accessible for the common man,” he added.

Convalescent plasma is in demand for treatment of Covid-19 patents after the ministry allowed for off-label or emergency use of plasma.

The state government appointed an expert committee with the help of the State Blood Transfusion Council. The committee has fixed the rates keeping in view the cost of collecting plasma by plasma apheresis method and the service charges for additional tests/special tests on blood as per the National Blood Policy. If the plasma bag is provided with a NAT test, the charges for the test have been capped at Rs1,200 per test (excluding the cost of plasma bag) and Rs 500 for a chemiluminescence test done on the plasma unit.

“The almost 25% cut in the rate of 200ml of plasma is good for patients. The capping exercise will introduce checks and balances and control blackmarketing,’’ said Dr Om Shrivastava, infectious diseases specialist, who is a member of the state task force on Covid.

The first plasma trial findings by the ICMR over a month back showed that it didn’t affect mortality rates. However, many doctors have said plasma has a role to play in mild to moderately ill patients.

“With the capping of rates, plasma will be available to patients at a nominal rate. The government will take strict action like revoking licences of blood banks which do not implement the rate and are found to overcharge,” said state health minister Rajesh Tope.

MUMBAI: Toll rates at Mumbai entry point booths at Vashi , Mulund, LBS Marg, Airoli and Dahisar will go up from October 1. The one-way toll for a passenger car, which was Rs35, will now be Rs40.

A state government notification said for toll recovery against cost of flyovers, bridges, subways and road development besides maintenance, the increase of roughly 18% in rates is made effective every three years. The toll of Rs35 has been constant for six years. The new rates will be applicable till September 30, 2023.

For light commercial vehicles (LCVs), the toll has been increased by Rs10 one-way to Rs65, and for trucks and buses by Rs25 each way to Rs130. For multi-axle vehicles (MAVs), the increase is of Rs25, to Rs160.

In September 2002, a toll was introduced at Vashi, Mulund, LBS, Airoli and Dahisar, and it was extended in 2010 on the pretext of maintenance. The collection contract will continue till September 2027.

Mumbai Entry Point Toll Ltd (MEPL) is expected to generate a cash flow of over Rs11,500 crore by 2027. MEP had paid Rs 2,100 crore upfront in 2010 to the state as part of the contract. If one considers the bank loan interest, maintenance cost and other charges over 17 years, Mumbaikars paid more than 10 times the initial cost of Rs 2,100 crore by 2017. The expansion of Vashi bridge lanes to 12 may add the toll period there till 2039.

"Sahitya Akademi winner works as farmhand after loss of job

KOLHAPUR: Sahitya Akademi Yuva Puraskar winner Navnath Gore ’s life changed swiftly when the coronavirus struck, and the lockdown in March temporarily closed the college in Ahmednagar district where he worked as a lecturer of Marathi on clocked hours.Gore, 32, who won the award for his debut novel ‘ Fesati ’, has been working as a farm labourer since April for Rs 400 a day to support his family when his income of a few thousands of rupees from teaching for the past two years dried up.His father passed away in February, and his responsibilities towards an aged mother and a physically challenged brother who live in Nigdi in Jat tehsil of Sangli district became stark.Gore said he had to return to his native village when it became tough to meet the expenses for food and their medicines.“My job in the college which I got after I won the Sahitya Akademi is not permanent. I earned about Rs 10,000 per month, but won’t get paid since it is on a clock-hour basis. The chances of earning something by taking up any work were brighter in Nigdi,” Gore told TOI.He travels in the periphery of 25km from his village for any agricultural work. “I get Rs 200 for half a day, and Rs 400 for a full day’s work,” he said.But work is not always available even though farm operations are at their peak in the monsoon. Gore is worried about getting any work once the agriculture operations are over.Born into a Dhangar (nomadic shepherding community) family, Gore has lived life only the hard way. Despite financial constraints, his mother insisted he complete his education.“I would run away to mind the flock instead of going to school,” he said.

"Century-old Parsi Gate, Marine Drive

MUMBAI: A group of concerned citizens started an online petition to save the Parsi Gate at Marine Drive, which is likely to be relocated by BMC for the coastal road. The petition says the over one century-old gate, built by Pallonji Mistry and philanthropist Bhagojisheth Kheer in 1915, has been in existence before Marine Drive was built. Within a few hours, the petition had over 1,000 signatures.

“The gate is carved with Zoroastrian motifs and made of Malad stone with steps between them to access the beach now called Chotta Chowpatty where all Mumbaikars could offer their prayers and offerings to the sea,” said Havovi Sukhadwala, who initiated the petition.

“Zoroastrians of Mumbai have been paying their respect to Avan Yazad [water deity] for over a century at the Parsi Gate. Hindus particularly use this safe access constructed to immerse the offerings on Poornima and ashes from the Chandanwadi crematorium at Marine Lines,” it said. The petition said the gate was identified as a place of worship in the 2016 Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) report of Coastal Road project, which BMC has now decided to remove and relocate a kilometre away. This, it said, “constitutes change or alteration as defined under Section 2(b) of The Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991”.

Sukhadwala said BMC has not sought an NOC from the Mumbai Heritage Conservation Committee. “The Parsi Gate is indeed the work of master craftsmen, whose labour of love has withstood the vastitude of the Arabian Sea, as admired by anyone who has stood at The Parsi Gate. Any permission to the “external changes” has to be secured by the Planning Authority in consultation with the Mumbai Heritage Conservation Committee,’’ she said.

“Furthermore, all buildings, monuments located at Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Road are designated as Marine Drive Precinct under Regulation 67 of the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act, 1966,” said the petition.

"MUMBAI: While a high percentage of pregnant women in Maharashtra have tested positive for Covid, only one in every 10 of these positive women had symptoms. This is the gist of a new research paper by the National Institute for Research in Reproductive Health (NIRRH), Parel, after analyzing data from the Preg-Covid registry network.Every pregnant woman in the country has to undergo a Covid-19 test ahead of her delivery date. “The ICMR in April introduced universal screening for pregnant women to check the spread of the disease,” said the study’s main author Dr Rahul Gajbhiye. The study is scheduled to be published in the European Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology and Reproductive Biology. As per the tests carried out among 1,140 pregnant women at 15 state government medical colleges between April 25 and May 20, 141 were positive for virus. “This works out to a positivity rate of 12.3% among pregnant women. While this may seem high in comparison to the spread among the general population, it must be considered that all pregnant women were screened, while not everyone in the general population is,’’ said Dr Gajbhiye.However, NIRRH director Dr Smita Mahale said the main concern is the high percentage of asymptomatic patients. The NIRRH team then studied the 141 positive pregnant women from the state government hospitals along with 180 positive pregnant women who delivered at BMCrun Nair Hospital and found only 37 were symptomatic.“This means the rest or 88.5% didn’t have any symptoms,” said Dr Mahale. If they hadn’t been tested, they would have spread the virus to others in the hospitals. Dr Deepak Modi, a co-author in the study, said, “Screening pregnant women is important not because they are at a higher risk of catching the infection, but also because they could spread it if they are unaware of their status.”",Maharashtra: ‘Only 1 in 10 pregnant Covid positive women had symptoms’

MUMBAI: A city psychiatrist has written to the national child rights body , demanding action against an advertisement that shows a child being slapped by his cricket coach. Complainant Dr Harish Shetty has alleged that the advertisement wrongly shows use of abuse as a sign of motivation for the child.

The advertisement, released recently by an e-wallet, shows that a child is slapped by his coach as he did not go to play a match. Another child advises him to change the coach, but he refuses. It also shows the child growing up to become a popular cricketer.

Shetty, also a child rights activist, said, “How are the makers trying to show slapping inspired the child? It violates child’s rights and sends a wrong message that physical abuse is normal...”

Swati Popat Vats of Early Childhood Association, said many advertisements violate child rights. “Advertising bodies must ensure rules are followed when children are involved.”

MUMBAI: Despite the pandemic, close to 2.3 lakh candidates from across the country registered for the common admission test ( CAT ) for admission to the premier IIMs and other B-schools. The exam is scheduled on November 29.

Although the numbers have dropped from last year’s 2.4 lakh, experts said the numbers are still encouraging, considering other national tests have seen a drop in aspirants during the pandemic. With employability in several sectors hit, many candidates see it as the best time to go back to school.

Himanshu Rai, director, IIM-Indore, the organising institute for CAT 2020, said, “The high registration numbers reflect the sustained interest students have in the field of management and in IIMs. In these challenging times, the CAT team is working hard to ensure a safe exam with social distancing and isolation facilities.” To allow students to take the test with social distancing norms, the two-hour paper will be conducted in three slots. Normally, the paper is three hours long.

JEE (Main and Advanced) for engineering saw a drop in registrations this year, mainly due to the pandemic. “While other competitive exams have seen a decline in numbers, the interest in CAT during a slowdown usually goes up. The market is stable for CAT aspirants. In fact, we were expecting the numbers to rise,” said Hemang Panchmatia, programme director at a coaching institute. The B-schools in tier-3 or 4 suffer during a slowdown, as people do not prefer to join these institutes. The ones in tier-1 and 2 are safe, he said, adding that this year, many waitlisted students got into IIMs.

Last year, of the 2.4 lakh aspirants who registered, 2.1 lakh appeared for the exam.

"TimesView Colleges should eliminate all the difficulties students are facing during mock tests to avoid problems during the actual exams. A helpline number should be provided to address technical queries. Despite all the measures, if students suffer due to lack of connectivity or device problems on the day of the exam, they should be allowed to attempt the test again. Many students will be anxious to give their final exam in the online format in the absence of physical invigilators. Colleges and universities should take this into account while framing exam rules.

MUMBAI: With the backlog exams (ATKT) for final-year students starting Friday, several colleges rushed to conduct the online mock tests this week. While many students found the sample questions easy, some reported technical glitches and inconvenience attempting the test in the online format.The state government and Mumbai University guidelines made it mandatory for colleges to conduct mock tests before holding online exams to familiarise students with the format.At an engineering college in central Mumbai, students were informed about the mock tests just two hours in advance. “No one was prepared. Our teachers asked us to attempt it anyway to get used to the format. Some students were not available as the portal was opened for a limited period. It was conducted in the most haphazard manner,” said a student. Some students with ATKTs found their schedule overlapping with the mock tests for regular final-year exams.In another cluster, 80% of students managed to give the mock exams smoothly; the rest faced a few technical issues. “There were problems with email IDs that couldn’t be located. Mails went into spam, students had problems with mobile cameras, connectivity issues. Some even pressed the wrong keys in anxiety. The help desk managed to guide them and some were issued a re-test,” said the principal.At a law college in south Mumbai, the mock exams were smooth for students who took it on laptops or computers. “Those taking it on phones reported a problem. A student was getting a call, and though he disconnected it, he got a notification saying ‘unusual activity was detected’. If this happens several times, the exam will be terminated or it is likely to show ‘unfair means’...Even an antivirus alert will be considered ‘unusual activity’,” said a student. At the college, a translator app was used to translate English questions to Marathi for students who had opted for it—they used the literal translation of an 18th century jurist’s name, which was distorted, said the student.At a suburban law college, students had to give the mock tests on Google Forms, with a security feature. “The questions were simpler, but students had a window of only five minutes to log into the portal. On the actual exam day, if we face network issues and are unable to log in on time, will we lose an attempt to give the exam?” asked a student.Another engineering student said the syllabus covered till March 13—deadline set by the state—by colleges in their cluster was different. “Our college completed five modules, two others completed three. To have a common syllabus, the colleges in the cluster are likely to cover only three modules for the exam.

"Kangana Ranaut (File photo)

MUMBAI: Shiv Sena spokesperson Sanjay Raut and a BMC official on Thursday sought time from the Bombay high court to file their replies to the petition filed by actor Kangana Ranaut against “illegal demolition” of part of her Bandra bungalow over alleged unlawful alterations in it for an office space.

A bench of Justices S J Kathawalla and Riyaz Chagla said it will start hearing her matter from Friday and observing that their turn to be heard will come later, gave Sanjay Raut and the civic official time till then to file their replies. Both are likely to file their replies by next week.

The bench said, “Cannot let property be left in a demolished state.” It hence said it would start the final hearing in the matter on Friday when senior counsel Anil Sakhare for the civic body requested the hearing may start next Monday. The HC noted, “Since 40% of the petitioner’s bungalow is already demolished on 9th September, 2020 and the bungalow continues to stand in partially demolished condition, it is likely some mishap may be caused due to the heavy rainfall in Mumbai. It is therefore necessary to hear the matter at the earliest.” Sakhare said the BMC would represent the H/W ward designated officer Bhagyawant Late too and sought two days to file his reply. At this, Justice Kathawalla shot back, “Will start hearing on Friday, you file later, otherwise you are very fast.”

Senior counsel Pradeep Thorat appeared for Raut and said, “I received papers now and will need time to reply.” He said there were only two allegations against Raut. Kangana had submitted a DVD with a clip of Raut’s interview of September 5 in which he allegedly abused her; she is also relying on another statement in a paper.

The actor has alleged the civic notice issued to her and demolition order are both “illegal” and issued with “malice and mala fide intentions” since she was at “loggerheads with the state government.”

On September 9, before her arrival to Mumbai from Manali, the BMC had started demolition which her lawyer Rizwan Siddiquee immediately challenged, and the HC then immediately stayed the demolition. The stay still continues.

The HC had on September 9 observed the civic action “smacked of mala fide.” BMC has denied any mala fide and said she had illegally altered the structure and added to it contrary to sanctioned plans and so demolition was lawful.

NAVI MUMBAI: Green activists have reiterated that accelerated effects of climate change are raising seawater levels, that can lead to a disaster for a coastal city like Mumbai, by 2050.

“A 2019 study report by the US group Climate Central has clearly stated how many parts of Mumbai are in danger of going underwater by 2050 due to effects of climate change. Then, there will be no use of infrastructure if everything will drown. The only way out is to take care of our environment now,” said environmentalist B N Kumar of NatConnect Foundation.

Activist Debi Goenka of Conservation Action Trust, said: “If rapid industrialization and wrecking of wetlands continues, I don’t think we will have to wait till 2050 for Mumbai to submerge since it can happen sooner. Ice in the Tundra region is also rapidly melting, which also exposes human race to pre-historic bacteria and micro-organisms trapped within permafrost ice. All these factors can destroy humans, if we don’t take proactive green steps now.’’ Activists also said many other coastal places in India can be submerged due to aggravated climate change.

MUMBAI: Scores of officegoers facing peak hour rush got a breather on Thursday. The Central Railway (CR) added 68 trips which can accommodate nearly 50,000 more essential staffers. In a first for Mumbai, the MSRTC launched 76 buses for intracity transport to ferry over 30,000 office-goers by road. The MSRTC buses have been taken on lease by BEST and a total 200 buses will be deployed by next week.

The total number of daily trips on CR has now gone up from 355 to 432. The Western Railway had recently increased its trips from 350 to 500. The CR’s new services include 22 additional services on Harbour line.

The special suburban services are being operated for essential services staff as notified by the state government, said CR chief spokesperson Shivaji Sutar. “In order to maintain social distancing and avoid crowding, we decided to increase the number of services. Of the total 423, 329 are on the main line, 92 on Harbour and two on the Transharbour corridor,” he said.

MSRTC will gradually increase the number of buses for Mumbai to 1,000 —which will be able to ferry additional 4-5 lakh office-goers. BEST spokesperson Manoj Varade said, “We have received 76 buses which were operated on Thursday on routes number 4 Ltd, 7 Ltd, 8 Ltd, C-72 and 30 Ltd.”

The state buses have full occupancy and unlike BEST, they can carry 44 passengers in a single trip. BEST has taken the buses on a rent of Rs 75 per km. Each bus will ply 150-200 km daily, and will be run by MSRTC conductors/drivers.

“The BEST has petitioned the government for permission to allow 100% occupancy in the red buses. We expect to get the government nod soon, and we can then ferry 67% more commuters in our own buses,” said BEST committee chairman Anil Patankar.

"A civic staffer at flooded Sion

MUMBAI: A ‘not-so-high’ high tide of 4.1m at 4am, less rainfall in the eastern suburbs, and 8,000 million litres of rainwater—equivalent to the supply capacity of Tulsi lake—flushed out into the sea helped minimise the flooding in Mumbai on Wednesday despite an overnight downpour, said the BMC.

BMC chief I S Chahal said that Mumbai received 83% of the month’s total average rainfall on Tuesday-Wednesday that flooded the city, but due to the efforts of the civic staffers, the rainwater receded faster.

Though the IMD Santacruz observatory recorded 286.4mm of rainfall in the 24 hours ending at 8.30am on Wednesday and the IMD Colaba station 147.8mm, there was less flooding in the suburbs compared to the island city as Mithi river and Vihar lake did not swell, said civic officials.

They pointed out that there was not much waterlogging in areas along Mithi river like Sakinaka, Kurla, Chunabhatti, Kalina and Bandra (E). Vihar had breached the overflow mark last month, but it did not flow over as the BMC has been drawing water out of the lake for daily use. As there was not much excess rainwater from Vihar lake flowing into Mithi even the river did not breach the banks.

BMC officials also claimed that the waterlogging situation and vehicular traffic and train services affected on Wednesday were not as severe as on August 5, when most parts of the city had gone under water, causing hardships to Mumbaikars.

Many politicans were, however, not convinced by the BMC claims. Samajwadi Party corporator and MLA Rais Shaikh said, “Nagpada and Agripada areas were badly affected on Wednesday as compared to August 5. There is some fault in the BMC pumping stations’ design or the operation which need to be audited by IIT experts. BMC had claimed that the Haji Ali and Worli pumping stations would help reduce waterlogging in these areas, but they failed.”

BJP corporator Akash Purohit said the rainwater did not recede for an entire day in many parts of south Mumbai on Wednesday, though the situation was a tad bit better than August 5. “The overall situation was better in the areas near Girgaum Chowpatty compared to last month.”

Meanwhile, the BMC demolished a couple of structures on the hill slope near Hanging Garden, that witnessed a mudslide on early Wednesday which broke the retaining wall of Khareghat Parsi Colony on Hughes Road. Officials said that the structures could have collapsed due to loose soil on the slope, so they decided to demolish them.

MUMBAI: The city can open up completely only if people cooperate and use masksthe social vaccine—against Covid-19, said BMC commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal on Thursday.

Speaking at a healthcare conference held by the Confederation of Indian Industry meeting on ‘Fighting the pandemic: Preparedness and road ahead’, Chahal said the ball is firmly in the citizens’ court as far as reopening is concerned.

The BMC has allowed the opening up of shops, offices, malls and hotels in varying degrees. “Opening up religious places may be next, but any decision on complete opening up to February level depends on the people,” he added. He recounted how during a visit to Goregaon he found around hundreds of people not wearing a mask or wearing it under their chin.

The commissioner said that in the last 45 days, the Covid pattern in the city had changed. “Around 80% of the patients are now from non-slum pockets” who think that jumbo hospitals are not up to the mark, he said. The BMC has, hence, roped in doctors from private hospitals to be available 24x7 on phone calls. “In the past few days, we have had senior bureaucrats and doctors getting treated at our jumbo facilities,’’ he said, adding that the perception about these centres will change soon.

According to Thursday’s health bulletin, 59,183 tests were carried out and the positivity rate was 6.4%, well below the national average. Officials said they were creating micro containment zones now which had resulted in the total number of such zones showing a sharp increase.“Experts believe that the second wave which has hit Delhi seems to have perhaps reached its peak. It will decline in the days to come,” said the chief minister, speaking to reporters after visiting Indian Agricultural Research Institute.Kejriwal pointed out that the government had increased the number of containment zones from 550 in the middle of August to over 2,000 now and hoped that this expansion would help in bringing down the number of positive cases.The CM said coronavirus cases were by and large under control in the capital between July 1 and August 17 when the city was reporting 1,100 to 1,200 cases on an average daily. “The cases started going up from August 17. As a responsible government, we did not take any risk and immediately scaled up testing,” he said, adding that the daily tests were increased from around 20,000 to 60,000.Kejriwal said aggressive testing and isolation of positive cases were the most effective way of defeating Covid-19. Had the government scaled down the daily tests to the previous level of 20000, cases would have come down to around 1500 daily, he said.Out of the total 2,059 containment zones at present, 1,612 are active. This means these zones have live cases while the others don’t have any but have still not been declassified according to the protocol that has been laid down. On September 1, there were 699 active containment zones in the city.South West district, which is spread over a huge area, has 341 containment zones at present, the highest in Delhi. It has also till date seen the highest number of containment zones –610. The areas that have a large number of containment zones include Raj Nagar, Mahavir Enclave and Mohan Garden, apart from some areas in Najafgarh, Dwarka and Uttam Nagar.West district has the second highest number of red zones –234. The increase, however, has been sharp in case of North West, New Delhi, North East, South East and Central districts.North West district, which has a population of around 37 lakh according to the 2011 census, has seen an almost eightfold rise in the number of Covid-19 cases this month. On September 1, the district had 29 containment zones and by September 23, the number had risen to 229. The areas that have seen a large number of containment zones being created this month include some sectors of Rohini and blocks of Ashok Vihar, Pitampura and Budh Vihar.“The containment zones in North West district were earlier spread over a much bigger area and it was realised that this could lead to more positive cases. Creation of micro containment zones helps not only in more efficient management but reduces the spread,” said a district official.“The strategy was changed and the number of containment zones were increased by creating some very small ones. “Initially, the number of active cases here was 20% which has now increased to 24%, which is at par with other districts,” he said. “Also, testing has become much more aggressive now compared to last month,” he said.New Delhi district, which had 40 containment zones at the beginning of the month, has seen the number go up 164. The most affected areas are different sectors of RK Puram and Vasant Kunj, apart from Naraina and Munirka.North East district, which has the lowest number of containment zones – 72 – has also seen a three-fold increase from September 1, when the figure was 19.“Extensive testing is resulting in more positive cases being detected, and whenever we see clustering of cases happening in any area, we create a containment zone. With many migrants coming back to Delhi and more offices and businesses opening, it is natural that there would be a rise in cases,” said another district official.",Covid-19: Containment zones in Delhi double
"NEW DELHI: Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia was shifted to Max Smart in South Delhi on Thursday evening from Lok Nayak hospital. Sources said the decision was taken following tests, which confirmed that Sisodia suffered from dengue in addition to Covid-19 A source at Max hospital said the deputy CM has been kept in the ICU of Max Smart, which is designated for Covid-19 treatment. “His condition is stable. There is nothing to worry about at present,” the source added.Co-infection due to Covid-19 and dengue is emerging as a serious problem and doctors at several city hospitals have reported such instances in the past one week. “We don’t know much about possible complications associated with such co-infection as Covid-19 is a new disease. It is important to monitor such patients to ensure there is no sudden deterioration,” doctors say.Sisodia had tested positive for Covid-19 on September 14. Initially, he was under home isolation. He was admitted to Lok Nayak hospital on Wednesday when he complained about breathing difficulty.Earlier, on June 17, Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain had tested positive for Covid-19. He was admitted to Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty hospital initially but later shifted to the Max hospital for administration of plasma therapy after developing pneumonia and having breathing trouble. He recovered in about two weeks.“Both dengue and Covid-19 are viral illnesses with no known cure. In dengue, a patient can go into shock due to extremely low blood pressure, which warrants medications to increase the blood pressure. On the other hand, in Covid-19, high blood pressure is linked to higher fatality,” the doctors say.Public health specialists say measures to prevent seasonal illnesses, more importantly dengue, need to be implemented strictly.“We have seen more than 40 dengue cases already this year. Of that, one patient had Covid-19 also. Fortunately, the patient came within two days of the onset of fever and timely medical intervention helped reduce the risk of complications,” Dr Ashutosh Biswas, professor of medicine at AIIMS, said. He added that co-infection adds to the risk of mortality and morbidity both.","Sisodia gets dengue too, moved to pvt hospital"
"Bid for more accountability at DJB

NEW DELHI: The operation, management and maintenance of water and sewage lines in Delhi will be handed over to private operators by Delhi Jal Board ( DJB ). Water procurement and supply will, however, continued to remain the responsibility of the water utility.In its board meet on Thursday, DJB approved the ‘One Zone, One Operator’ policy to enable private firms to take over the care and management of pipelines after the city is divided into 7-8 zones. These private firms will be appointed for 10 years.Ankit Srivastava, technical adviser to DJB, described the step as “not at all being akin to the privatisation of distribution of electricity in the power sector”. All work entrusted to the private companies will also remain under DJB’s supervision and no board employee will be laid off. Officials disclosed that notices calling for the new operators will be issued around October 1. The zones will be determined based on the hydraulics of the regions.After the meeting chaired by Delhi water minister and chairman of DJB Satyendar Jain on Thursday, Srivastava, explaining that the step was not a drastic change from the present setup, said, “To date, we issue many small tenders for repair and maintenance works by private contractors across the water supply network. Under the new model, these works will be consolidated among fewer companies. A defined area will be the responsibility of an operator with fixed deliverables for both water pipelines and sewerage.”Srivastava noted that the appointment of a single company in each defined zone will ensure accountability and guarantee quality work. “This is a precursor to 24x7 supply of water in the capital,” he added.A DJB official said that no board employee would be terminated in the process and no government post was being replaced by private players. “Also, DJB officials will continue to have supervisory roles. For example, even now the 200 sewer cleaning machines are managed by private players, but an DJB official always supervises the work.”The official added the new consultants would fix the nitty-gritty of works related to the water and sewer lines, including expansions of pipe size, repair, connections, etc. “Instead of dividing such work into hundreds of small packets, the whole can be entrusted to one company which will carry it out at one go,” the official argued. The only exceptions will be the three small areas where PPP projects on water supply improvement are being currently run.DJB manages around 14,500km of water pipelines and 9,000 km of sewer lines to ensure water supply and sewage services to 20 million people in Delhi. The board is responsible for the procurement of raw water, its treatment and the supply. “DJB currently takes wastewater from New Delhi Municipal Council and Delhi Cantonment Board areas, both of which are responsible for the provision of local sewer networks within their own territories,” the official said.The water utility said that extensive deliberations at various levels were held before it was decided to induct private operators for the operation, maintenance and management of the water and sewage networks. While studying the models in other cities, it was noticed that only a single operator had been appointed. “Delhi being a large metropolitan city will have to be divided in 7-8 zones,” one official said. “The zonation will be done through hydraulic studies of the region, underground reservoir areas and sewage outfall boundaries.”DJB has also approved of a simplified procedure for a new water and sewage connection. The online process will be paperless and integrated with the doorstep delivery of public services. The board has cleared the proposal to install 200 tubewells in the floodplain at Palla in a phased manner to extract raw water supply. An official added that the board also discussed the implementation of the polluter-pays principle as directed by National Green Tribunal.","DJB to hand over water, sewage lines to pvt cos"
"NEW DELHI: Three people, including a 12-year-old boy, were killed and three others injured after a speeding Cluster Scheme bus lost control on a flyover in northeast Delhi’s Nand Nagri late on Thursday night. The bus rammed into several vehicles and street vendors before coming to a stop. Angry local residents pelted stones at the bus and broke its windows.Police received a call about the accident around 10pm on Thursday. Eyewitnesses told the cops that the Cluster bus was coming down the ITI flyover near Nand Nagri when it seemed to careen out of control. “The bus was moving at a high speed and first rammed into a truck, after which it mowed down pedestrians and hit the street vendors before stopping. The deceased were walking on the road when they were mowed down. The driver of the bus fled from the site, leaving the bus there,” said Ved Prakash Surya, DCP (Northeast).Two of the three men who died in the accident have been identified as Ravinder (22) and Karan (12). The identity of the third, aged around 40, is yet to be established. The injured include a teenager, Sujeet (16) and the husband-wife duo of Satish (45) and Kanchan (35). The three were taken to Swami Dayanand Hospital in the area for treatment.“A case of rash and negligent driving causing death has been registered,” said DCP Surya. “The situation in the area is under control.” Several police teams have been formed to track the missing bus driver.Soon after the accident, several local residents gathered at the junction near Nand Nagri. Police sources revealed that some people had spread rumours about the death of 5-6 people, leading to the locals getting agitated and damaging the bus.In a video of the incident shot by a local, several people can be seen pelting stones at the Cluster bus which stands by the roadside. The video also shows young boys later kicking a PCR van that was trying to make its way out of the area.

"BENGALURU: With Covid-19 fatalities surging and cemeteries and crematoriums struggling to keep pace, the government has decided to set up designated burial grounds and crematorium across all major cities and towns in the state. In Bengaluru, the government plans to develop nine new crematoriums in addition to the existing 10.“We have already invited tenders and work will begin soon. We have decided against developing designated burial grounds because of want of land and stiff opposition from residents,” said BBMP commissioner N Manjunatha Prasad. “Before crematoriums used to get 100 to 120 bodies, but now they get 165 or more,” Prasad said.Municipal administration and urban development departments have already asked district deputy commissioners and civic body chiefs to identify open land to streamline disposal of Covid-19 bodies.“Each of these burial grounds and crematoriums will be developed at a cost of Rs 25-30 lakh. The idea is to ensure patients who have died of Covid-19 get a dignified farewell,” said municipal administration minister KC Narayana Gowda. “These burial grounds and cremation centres will be reserved so that there is no confusion or commotion.”The government plans to earmark one acre of land for burial grounds and crematoriums in all 30 districts. All religions and sects that bury their dead will be allowed to use these grounds.Demands from communities who bury their dead to earmark space for last rites have been growing. But due to the shortage of burial grounds and stigma associated with Covid-19 fatalities, many bodies have been cremated. Residents living near burial grounds have also protested against burying Covid-19 dead there, while crematorium staffs have expressed anxiety in handling the bodies as they fear infection.The government has instructed managements of burial grounds to demarcate space to bury Covid fatalities and to erect ‘ Covid Graveyard ’ signboards besides preparing a separate approach. The site will be protected with barbed-wire and it will have security room, waiting hall, rest rooms and other facilities. Only five people will be allowed to attend the last rites and they will be given disposable masks and sanitisers by the Covid liaison officer in the hospital.",Karnataka: Separate Covid burial grounds planned

"File photo: Former AIADMK secretary VK Sasikala

BENGALURU: Former AIADMK secretary VK Sasikala , who is serving a four-year imprisonment in a disproportionate assets case , has written to Central Jail, Bengaluru, authorities requesting them not to share information on her release with anyone, including RTI activists.

Earlier this month, a citybased activist had received details about her release dates by applying under the Right To Information Act. According to the reply, the tentative date of Sasikala’s release will be January 27, 2021 if she pays Rs 10 crore levied by the court that convicted her. If she fails to pay the fine, her release date will be February 27, 2022.

“I’ve learnt that several applications are being filed by third parties under RTI seeking information about details of my imprisonment, date of release, etc. They file these applications for certain reasons — to gain publicity and for political vendetta. The oblique motives of some of the applicants are to complicate my lawful release at the right time,” she wrote.

She pointed out that in a similar matter (Central Jail, Tihar vs Information Commission in which the verdict was given on April 24, 2019), an applicant under RTI sought certain information related to an undertrial detained at Tihar jail. “The information was denied stating that details of undertrial prisoners as well as convicts are personal and any such revelation of their identity is barred under section 8

(1)(J) of RTI Act. The Central Information Commission concurred with the stand by referring to the Supreme Court’s view that right to privacy is a fundamental right,” the two-page letter read.

A prison official confirmed receiving the letter. “In this case, the RTI applicant had complained against prison officials with the state information commission when we refused to share details. However, we’re taking advice from legal experts and senior prison officials before taking a call on her request,” he said.

Sasikala, her foster-son VN Sudhakaran and close relative J Ilavarasi have been lodged at Central Jail since February 15, 2017, after the Supreme Court set aside their acquittal by the Karnataka high court.

"Team time trial winners Naveen John (L) and GT Gagan Reddy

Bengaluru: No race organisers at the start point, no race marshals on the route, and none to record your time at the finish point. This may seem bizarre but that’s the new normal for competitive cycling in the Garden City amid the Covid-19 pandemic.

With the emphasis on contactless racing, cycling has relied on technology, the Strava app to be precise, to get racing going again. Four races, all time trials (race against the clock), have been held so far with the help of the app.

Taking a cue from an event held by Madras Racing Circuit, national champion Naveen John conducted the first competitive race last month in Bengaluru, considered the hub of cycling in the country now. He aptly named it the ISO TT (self-ISOlated TT), a 24-km race on Kolar highway.

“I had the sense that everyone was itching to do something (racing) and I thought let me do it in a responsible way. It worked out positively and got the ball rolling,” John told TOI. He organised another race over the same distance at the end of the month that had the cream of the city’s talent participating.

“We had about 45 showing up for the first event and 55 for the second. It was on a small scale, but I think it is the best way to start things off,” added the five-time National champion.

It was not long before BBCh (Bangalore Bicycle Championship), one of the biggest and popular racing platforms in the country, conducted an MTB race with about 25 competitors. “We wanted to check how non-contact racing works with proper Covid-19 protocols in place. We were able to pull it off,” said Khuram Pasha, a BBCh council member.

Now, Pasha and team are keen on an ITT for road cyclists next month. “Our committee decided to start with an ITT, which we were supposed to do in March before the lockdown kicked in. We’re planning to resume and are in the process of getting the permission,” he added.

Last Sunday, Bangalore Amateur Racing’s (BAR) Venkateswara Rao Navanasi conducted a two-man team time trial event over the regular 33.3-km route on the Chennai highway. “I don’t think we are in a safe zone yet, but ITT is the safe bet right now,” said Navanasi, who plans to organise BAR’s usual race on the first Sunday of every month.

With cycling getting into competitive mode and leading the way in restarting sport, it won’t be long before other disciplines follow suit.

HOW STRAVA WORKS

Strava allows users to record a host of activities, including cycling, running and swimming, and upload them to be viewed and analysed. The app records GPS data in real time and tracks a number of metrics. Strava segments are defined sections where athletes can compete against one another. One needs to download the app and start racing from a given point. The competitor starts before the segment and ends after the segment. Once the participants upload the ride, Strava will calculate the segment time to determine the placings.

"Karnataka medical education minister K Sudhakar

BENGALURU: After speculation spread rapidly on social media that the government is contemplating another Covid-19-induced lockdown in Karnataka — a lot of it generated after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s interaction with the state on Wednesday — the state government on Thursday clarified there was no such proposal before it.

Speaking to reporters, medical education minister K Sudhakar clarified that Prime Minister Narendra Modi did suggest imposing a lockdown to curb surging cases, but insisted it was not binding on any of the states that participated in the interaction with him.

“It was more a suggestion from his side rather than a direction,” Sudhakar said. “Moreover, there is no reason to implement it in Karnataka.” Citing a suggestion from Modi, he said it is more important for state governments to focus on micro-containment zones. “It was a fruitful discussion. No one should misinterpret or misguide people in the state or elsewhere. There will be no seal down also,” said Sudhakar.`

Meanwhile, Karnataka tourism minister CT Ravi underlined that though the state government wanted to increase awareness about Covid-19, yet there is no talk regarding another lockdown.

“What needs to be done is for people to strictly follow safety protocols if at all we want to fight this dreaded virus. There will be no lockdown in Bengaluru or elsewhere in the state,” said Ravi.

"Bengaluru: Karnataka’s management of the pandemic ran into a fresh hurdle on Thursday when 30,000 contractual staff working under National Health Mission (NMH) struck work, even as the government ordered district officials to crack down and take action against them.

Karnataka state health and medical education department contractual employees’ forum includes doctors, nurses and data entry operators. While clinical staffers are working, data entry operators have struck work.

These employees are tasked with sending reports to the state headquarters and play a prominent role in Covid-19 data management. They also run front offices in most hospitals, handle clerical work like admissions and OPD referrals and tabulate public health work.

The employees held a token protest on Wednesday, sending state’s data into disarray. Only four districts reported fatalities, bringing the day’s toll down to 38 from 100-plus. Zero discharges were reported from 15 districts, inflating the tally of active cases.

On Thursday, members of the forum submitted their memorandum to district authorities, seeking early settlement of their demands. Contract workers are demanding Covid-risk incentives which other doctors, nurses, auxiliary nurse midwives, lab technicians and pharmacists are drawing.

“Job security, equal pay for equal work and insurance cover are some of our demands. Unless these long-pending demands are met, we will not return to work,” said forum president Vishwaradhya HY.

The impact of the protest was acute. In Bengaluru, KC General hospital, the ART centre and the TB testing unit are likely to remain non-functional from Friday if the protest continues.

“We have 15 contractual staffers under NHM. They worked till the afternoon and left. They informed us that they will not be working from tomorrow. We will have to make alternative arrangements,” said Dr BR Venkateshaiah, medical superintendent, KC General.

Arundhati Chandrashekar, mission director, NMH, Karnataka, in a circular on Wednesday, came down hard on protesters saying their behavior was “inappropriate” given the pandemic scenario. She directed deputy commissioners to take strict action against staff who don’t cooperate.

Arundhati told TOI several districts sent Covid reports on Thursday. “If the risk incentive is extended to all employees under NHM, there will be a similar demand from all state government employees,” she said.

Health commissioner Pankaj Kumar Pandey said most of the demands of the staff were met including the hike in salary and Covid risk allowance for medical, paramedical staff. “A committee formed by the government has looked into their demands. Their salary has been increased. It's time all employees of the health department work together.”

● There are 1,200 registered competitive swimmers across Karnataka

● 50 registered centres across the state

● Maintaining a 25-meter-long pool costs RS.1,50,000 to RS.2,00,000

● Refilling a pool costs RS.1,00,000 for six lakh litres of water

● There are over 500 public-use pools in Bengaluru

(according to a study)

Besides being an IT hub, Bengaluru is also known as the swimming capital of the country. It is home to two of the country’s top coaches — Pradeep Kumar and Nihar Ameen — who have trained hundreds of national and international swimmers. In addition, nine Olympic swimmers from India were trained in the city. And yet, when Unlock 4.0 guidelines were released by the Ministry of Home Affairs, swimming pools were still not allowed to open.

COACHES AND POOL OPERATORS STRUGGLE TO STAY AFLOAT

“It is the only sport that is not allowed by the government to function. Even gyms and other close contact sports have been allowed to open,” says Arjuna Awardee and former Olympian swimmer Nisha Millet , who adds that with six months of zero income, it has been a tough ride. “I run two pools in the city and they were drained, scrubbed and cleaned recently, as it was too expensive to pay electricity and maintenance bills for the past six months,” she says.

Besides Nisha, there are other coaches who are struggling to stay afloat. Ekalavya Awardee and senior swimming coach for competitive swimmers, Shreesh Reddy says, “If we open up, we will take precautions. If other countries are operating with one or two swimmers per lane, we are also willing to follow all guidelines.” Shreesh has also penned an emotional note on PM Modi’s Mann

Ki Baat app and has received an acknowledgement from his office.

BUT IS SWIMMING SAFE DURING THE PANDEMIC?

In answer to that, Shreesh says, “Nowhere has it been proved that the virus spreads in water. In fact, the chlorine in the pool water will neutralise the virus.” Adding to this, Nisha points out that swimming is good for the lungs, and keeping the lungs healthy is important

now. Talking about the importance of teaching swimming, a spokesperson from Swimming Matters says, “Swimming is a life-saving skill and by not being able to teach people to swim, we are putting that many people at risk. Furthermore, drowning is the second highest preventable cause of death in India after road accidents. And with coaches not being able to teach,many are losing that touch with water.”

COMPETITIVE SWIMMERS TAKE A HIT

The Swimming Matters spokesperson adds that aquatics is one of the biggest sports at the Olympics in terms of medal count. “Forty nine gold medals at the games include swimming, diving, water polo, synchronised swimming and open water swimming.The tally touches close to 100, if we are to include other activities related to the sports,” she says. Shreesh adds that because of the pandemic, the student population at his academy has reduced by 25%. “It takes three to four years to train a competitive swimmer. I am an Ekalavya awardee and it took me 20 years to get to my peak. Now, with the 2020 pandemic,we have already lost swimmers who were in the system for three to four years. Every single day that you do not swim, you have to slog for three to four days to make up for it. This worries me,” he says.

KARNATAKA SWIMMING ASSOCIATION AWAITS A GREEN SIGNAL

Despite the Karnataka Swimming Association (KSA) trying to push for the cause, there seems to be no respite. “Training has started everywhere including Dubai and Sri Lanka and nowhere has a COVID-19 case been reported. Our request to permit at least 20

pools which would be supervised by KSA following all SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) has also not been given a green signal. All studies and case studies have been submitted, but we are yet to convince the Centre,” says M Satish Kumar , secretary, KSA.

EXPECTATIONS OF SWIMMERS

An ongoing survey by Swimming Matters, has so far covered over 200 participants from across 20 plus cities. The participants included competitive swimmers, recreational swimmers and parents of swimmers. The survey reveals...

● 75% believe swimming pools are safe

● 72% will start swimming as soon as pools open

● 55% can pay a marginally higher fee to cover costs of sanitisation and social distancing measures

The Bus Priority Lane will get 160to keep a check on people encroaching into this lane. If all goes well, by the end of this year the BPL will function effectively as it was meant to beThe Bus Priority Lane, a dedicated lane for buses, was inaugurated on November 15, 2019, along the outer ring road (ORR).Though thehad notified that all other vehicles would be prohibited from this lane, violations continue with impunity.To stop such violations,and the Traffic police have decided to install high-definition cameras.Around 160 such cameras will be installed all along the Outer Ring Road (ORR) fromto KR Puram and on old Madras road (the stretch from KR puram to Baiyappanahalli). The police believe that technology can help in nabbing and penalising traffic offenders who encroach into the BPL.Confirming this,commissionersaid that they have called for tenders for the same and will soon go ahead with the project.The proposal to this effect has been mooted by the traffic police department. A senior BBMP official told Mirror, “We have identified a 16-km road along the ORR which would mean that we need cameras for the 32-km stretch (16 kms on either side). The cameras have the capability to capture the number plate at a distance of 250 metres. Hence, we will require at least four such cameras for every kilometre.The traffic police have also requested for additional cameras and we will be installing 160 such cameras. We need more cameras at the junction. These cameras will be connected to a command centre where the police will monitor the violations.”Though the BPL has been put in place, it has not yet been effectively implemented for lack of manpower. A police official said that it has been a Herculean task as they cannot post personnel all along the road. Currently, many vehicles (other than the buses) intrude into the BPL thereby defeating the whole purpose. Hence, they have been demanding cameras to keep a tab on the violators. The BBMP officials said that the cameras will also help in keeping a tab on miscreants vandalising bollards or committing other petty crimes. Adriver said, “BPL has helped to provide us with a hassle-free drive along the ORR which houses hundreds of IT and other companies. If the service is efficient, then we will get many passengers. However, there are many problems with the BPL as many fail to follow the rules.”The total cost of the project to install cameras has been pegged at Rs 3 crore. The tender bids are likely to be opened by October 11 and the approvals are to be accorded by mid-October. The project is likely to start by the first week of November and if all goes well, the cameras will be functional from the first week of December, according to BBMP officials. This collaborative project has BBMP as the financial partner, the traffic police as the enforcement wing, DULT is chipping in with planning and BMTC being the end user is the operational partner.Currently, a pop-up bicycle lane is also being laid along the ORR. BMTC has also introduced cycle racks on its buses to stack cycles while cyclists travel in the buses.

KOLKATA: A Nigerian and an Ivory Coast national were arrested from Bangalore by Bidhannagar police’s cyber crime department for allegedly duping a Salt Lake resident for over 82 lakh over a span of several weeks.

Police said, the two used to fake their identities and approach middle aged men posing as women on social media and after a few weeks of friendship, they would lure them into a business as a partner and then dupe them. In this case, the duo had approached Salt Lake resident Kushal Das Mahapatra, made friendship and then asked him to invest in a seed business.

“Mahapatra was asked to invest slowly into the business and was told that there was huge demand of indigenous seeds of Indian plants in the international market of which they had proper connection. The complainant had paid Rs 82 lakh in three instalments before realising he was being duped,” said a senior officer of Bidhannagar Commissionerate.

Based on the complaint, cops tracked the IP address of the fraudsters and landed at their Bangalore address and arrested Ivoririenne Donous Arnold Patrick (30) and Nigerian Bake Asoro (30) from different apartments at Hennur Gardens in Bangalore on Wednesday. They were produced before a local court and were being brought to Kolkata in transit remand.

HYDERABAD: After scrutinising his assets for two days, assistant commissioner of police (ACP) (Malkajgiri) Y Narasimha Reddy was formally arrested by Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) sleuths on Thursday. Hours before his arrest, he had been transferred and directed to report at the DGP’s office.

Later, after legal formalities, Reddy was sent in judicial remand to Chanchalguda central prison till October 8.

On the second day of scrutiny, the ACB team unearthed four more acres in Shankarpally linked to a woman, reportedly a benami of the Rachakonda police officer, and found 300 grams of gold in a bank locker. ACB sleuths also stated that Reddy had deliberately undervalued properties in purchase agreements to ensure family assets would not appear disproportionate.

An ACB team analysing documents seized at Narasimha Reddy’s house at Mahendra Hills in Marredpally and residences of his benamis found that Reddy had obtained a Rs 90 lakh bank loan to run a hotel at Abdullapurmet on the one acre leased for 12 years by placing passbook of 4 acres 13 guntas agricultural land in Shankarpally.

The land is in the name of a 45-year-old woman suspected to be his benami. “The woman went to the US in June to see her daughters. Her husband, a retired government employee, confessed that the payment for the purchase of land was made by the ACP,” an ACB official said.

Plots undervalued by Reddy: ACB

Reddy’s wife is the joint owner of four plots measuring 1,960 square yards in front of Cyber Towers. Two other men, including a realtor from Amberpet and an MPP from Karimnagar who co-own these plots along with her, have also been questioned by the ACB suspecting they were his benamis.

“The four plots in front of Cyber Towers were purchased by Reddy’s wife and two of their associates in 2018 from different persons for Rs 4,000 a square yard, whereas the market price is Rs 3 lakh per square yard. The persons who sold the plots received the property from their parents as gift deeds in 2016 and the deeds were registered in LB Nagar sub-registrar office. We are trying to identify and question the people who sold the land,” an ACB investigator said.

ACB personnel also found that Reddy had paid Rs 38 lakh on behalf of his wife to join an eight-flat apartment construction project at Puppalguda taken up by two ex-software employees on a 500-square yard after coming to an agreement with them that he would get two flats.

The agency claimed to have found out that Reddy had undervalued plots purchased at the time of registration so that value of assets owned by his family would not appear disproportionate. “Reddy had purchased a 222-square yard plot in Hafeezpet in his wife’s name for Rs 2.5 lakh in 2010. Similarly, he purchased 268-square yard plot in Pocharam a few years ago for Rs 78 lakh but in the agreement its value was shown as Rs 8 lakh. However, we secured the Rs 78 lakh transaction document from the person who sold the land,” an ACB official said.

ACB personnel also opened an Andhra Bank locker and found 300 grams gold. Two bank lockers of the woman who went to the US were yet to be opened. “A few weeks before the ACB raid, a news article appeared in a magazine about discreet inquiry being made against the ACP. We suspect he cleared out most of the documents and other valuables after the article was published. The locker was last operated on September 14, said an ACB official.

"HYDERABAD: Telangana high court on Thursday questioned the state government when it would implement its oft-repeated promise of turning every bed in the state-run hospitals into oxygen beds. It also sought to know as to why the government is not doing more Covid-19 tests.A bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy asked these queries to advocate general BS Prasad while hearing a batch of Covid-related PILs. “Why cannot the government keep doing more tests because that is the only way we can keep the pandemic under control?” They posted the case to October 8, while asking the registry to tag all the fresh Covid PILs to this batch of petitions. Citing a TOI report published in Thursday, the judges said: “Telangana is lagging behind most of the states. When Covid-19 is all about lungs getting adversely affected and the supply of oxygen is an essential aspect, why is the government unable to gear up its infrastructure in all hospitals?”The judges asked the government to file an affidavit on its plans to shore up the oxygen bed strength in the state. “WHO has recommended that we must have five oxygen beds for every 1,000 population. We do not have even one such bed for a 1,000 people. At least three beds for a 1,000 people would be ideal in our conditions,” the judges said.

HYDERABAD: Researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad are using artificial intelligence (AI) based algorithms to detect mobile phone usage among drivers.

Distraction caused due to usage of mobile phones during driving is one of the major factors behind the increasing number of road accidents. Researchers have used algorithms based on deep-learning to detect mobile-phone usage on a dataset. The algorithm runs at nearly 27 frames-per second on a high end graphics processing unit (GPU), which means it can process a video in real-time.

Dr Sparsh Mittal, the lead researcher, said, “We believe that our technique has immense potential. It can help in avoiding accidents due to distraction during driving. It can help improve productivity by preventing excess or untimely usage of the mobile phone.”

The algorithm can also help track mobiles being used at restricted places or lost phones. Explaining, Mittal said mobile phones are prohibited in many places such as petrol pumps, exam halls, embassies, military bases, and courts of law, and their tool can be used to find whether the mobile phone is being used in such areas. “Many financial transactions now happen on mobile phones, and hence, the loss of mobile phones can have severe consequences. By allowing tracking of mobile phone, our technique can help in detecting loss or theft of the mobile phone,” said Mittal.

Elaborating on this research, Poonam Rajput, research scholar at IITH, said, “ We have used algorithms based on deep-learning to detect mobile-phone usage. Our fastest algorithm runs at nearly 27 frames-per-second on a high-end GPU, which means it can process a video in real-time. Our algorithms achieve nearly 99% accuracy on the Kaggle Driver dataset and 96% accuracy on the IITH-DMU dataset. Our work is the first to detect mobile phones’ usage in both indoor and outdoor environments with a lot of clutter.”

"CHENNAI: From being a car-owning and argumentative trial court lawyer to an absconding double murder suspect, lawyerK Ravi did it all during the five years of his underground living.Within a few months after killing his two children aged 13 and 11, and fleeing Chennai, Ravi sold his car in Odisha, stopped using his mobile phone to call anyone or ATM to withdraw money, worked as a construction labourer and slept at under-construction sites, and lifted gunny bags to earn a living. His caution did slip twice – once in Odisha and then in Delhi – but before police could nab him, he managed to escape.The cat-and-mouse game involving Ravi and the Maduravoyal police finally ended due to the pandemic-induced lockdown which immobilised Ravi and left him stuck at a nondescript lodge in Periyamet near Chennai Central railway station.Ravi shot to infamy on June 3, 2015, when his neighbours at CMDA Colony in Maduravoyal woke up to a foul smell emanating from his flat. It was only after the flat was broken into that the decomposing bodies of his children -- Aishwarya Priyadarshini and Jayakrishna Prabhu – were found. Investigation revealed that Ravi had struck his daughter with a sharp object and then strangulated his son and left their bodies on the bed. He had lit a candle under the cot and spread old clothes all around before opening the gas cylinder. “He had to fake a fire accident, but there was not enough gas in the cylinder,” an official said.Long before the murders, Ravi had stopped sending the children to school for a year. When the murder came to light, apart from his absence, Ravi’s brusque manner with the neighbours made him the prime suspect. CCTV footage showed that Ravi exited the apartments on May 28, a week before his children’s bodies were found.Three inspectors took over the case and several special teams searched for him, but to no avail. “This was a challenging case and the special teams were following it up,” said additional commissioner of police, A Arun.Ravi left the city in his sedan and toll records showed him crossing Andhra Pradesh border on May 30. Once police got wind of his presence in Bhubaneswar railway station, but they could not nab him. Ravi assumed a new identity and worked as a construction labourer and took up other menial jobs all these years in Odisha and Telengana.A special team led by Maduravoyal inspector Ravindran and sub inspector Chelladurai went to his native village near Madurai and decided to plant laundryman and petty shops owners in the locality as decoys.In August, police received a tip-off from a person at Ravi’s daughter’s school saying someone had approached them for the child’s transfer certificate. Police did track the person and his contact list showed a call from a mobile number belonging to Ravi. It is not clear as to why he was trying to retrieve the transfer certificate of his children, but that proved to be vital move that landed Ravi back on police radar. Then it was a matter of time before the long arm of law finally caught up with Ravi.Investigators are surprised Ravi never attempted to change his appearance, though he did try a beard for a while. He, however, diligently avoided contacting any of his acquaintances even once for at least for two years after he fled. Investigators say Ravi came to Chennai in January seeking monetary help from a friend. The unexpected lockdown in March, halted his escape plan. He then decided to stay put at the lodge as he thought police would be busy in pandemic-related work. This one time his calculations failed, and he got arrested.",Chennai: Killer lawyer led life of homeless worker

CHENNAI: The Madras high court ordered 30 days of parole (leave) for Rajiv Gandhi assassination life convict A G Perarivalan citing his ‘multiple comorbid illness’.

Though the state refused leave to Perarivalan under exemption available in the prison rules, a division bench of Justice N Kirubakaran and Justice P Velmurugan directed the state to grant him parole.

“In view of the undisputed facts regarding multiple comorbid illness being suffered by the petitioner’s son, his chances of getting infection being higher and not being given treatment in government hospital as well as Stanley Medical College hospital due to pandemic situation and ripe age and illness of the parents of the convict, who is away from them for the past 29 years, it is appropriate to direct the government to grant 30 days leave to the petitioner’s son,” the bench said.

The issue pertains to a habeas corpus plea moved by Perarivalan’s mother Arputham seeking 90 days parole for her son on medical grounds .

Passing the order, the bench said, “The then government, headed by late chief minister J Jayalalithaa... by decision dated February 19, 2014 recommended to the central government to release all the convicts. Subsequently, the present government, by resolution dated September 9, 2018 decided to release the convicts prematurely invoking the powers under Article 161of the Constitution and made a recommendation to the governor.”

When such decisions have been taken wherein the convicts are eligible to lead a normal life without any restriction, there is no occasion for the government to oppose the grant of leave to the petitioner’s son, especially, when a case has been made out for relaxation on undisputed health grounds, the court added.

CHENNAI: Greater Chennai Coporation in four-and-ahalf months reaches a major milestone in terms of fever camps. The civic body has now conducted more than 50,000 fever camps , screened 26.33 lakh people across the city and tested close to 1.5 lakh people for Covid-19.

As on Wednesday night , the corporation has conducted 50,929 camps with an average of 52 outpatients visiting each camp.

Using these drives, the civic body was able to zero in on 1.54 lakh people with influenza-like illness (ILI) symptoms and has taken swab samples from 1.48 lakh. Around 24,224 of them have turned positive, translating into a positivity rate of around 15%, latest data revealed.

Fever camps has been a trump card for the corporation’s Covid-19 response. “During the lockdown period, we vigorously conducted camps near residential localities. As offices had not opened up, we canvassed in streets urging people to get themselves checked. This helped up us pluck out many hidden Covid cases,” said a senior civic body official.

In June and July, doctors worked double shifts and conducted close to 550 camps a day.

The civic body is still holding close to 450 camps every day now after all offices and public transport are up and running. On Wednesday, 444 camps were conducted, with highest number of ILI symptomatic people recorded in Teynampet (221) and Adyar (139), areas which have a higher number of residents with comorbid conditions.

While the average number of outpatients during lockdown period was close to 70, it has now come down to about 49.

A corporation official said they have changed their strategy. “People who go to offices will need to take a day off if they are unwell. So we have started conducting these camps near offices, important junctions and construction sites so people can get themselves checked and return to work or get medical attention immediately,” the official said.

CHENNAI: The directorate of medical examination is planning a completely online single-window counselling for undergraduate medical courses — including choice selection and seat allotment — for 2020 admissions to reduce chances of a Covid-19 spread.

Officials in the state selection committee have been doing dummy runs for the process over the past few days, health secretary J Radhakrishnan said. “We don’t want aspirants to travel long distances for the sake of counselling. The committee was able to carry out single window counselling successfully for postgraduate students earlier this year. The software is now being upgraded and tested for the MBBS course,” he said.

Unlike the PG programme, where students have to lock colleges and courses of choice, the application process is simpler for UG students as they only have to choose colleges. The state is expecting about 35,000- 40,000 applicants for MBBS admission to 41 medical colleges – 26 state-run colleges and 15 self-financing medical colleges. The challenge in the UG course is to verify community and nativity certificates. The agency chosen to conduct counselling is working on the new software. “We are looking at linking websites with the revenue department for online verification so officials there can verify certificates of selected students. We will also be using fingerprint and iris scanners to ensure there is no impersonation,” a senior official in the directorate of medical education said.

Until now, counselling for PG and UG medical courses in the state was being conducted at counselling centres. Online counselling is offered by the Directorate General of Health Services in Delhi for allotment of seats in government colleges across the country under the all India quota and for central and deemed universities. In 2019, health minister C Vijaya Baskar said the selection committee was testing a software that would allow aspirants to download and submit applications, lock their choices, and download admit cards after seats are allotted based on NEET rank and rules of reservation. But it did not happen because committee members said they may not be able to verify the authenticity of documents submitted online.

"CHENNAI: Shot by a Film and Television Institute of India ( FTII ) Pune faculty member during lockdown , the music video “Maya Nadhi” celebrates the diversity and rootedness of traditional Indian music, mainly from Tamil Nadu, Kerala, West Bengal and Maharashtra.

The Tamil segment is based on ‘Karakattam’, a folk dance performed in praise of the rain goddess Mariamman.

Conceptualised by Thivakaran T, a faculty member at the cinematography department of the FTII, the idea behind the making of the six-minute-long video was to showcase the connection between various music traditions belonging to different cultures.

The students who stayed back on campus during the lockdown worked on this project. It was shot entirely on the campus hostel premises with all the lockdown related guidelines being followed.

“‘Maya Nadhi’ is an anthological video to highlight and celebrate the diversity and rootedness of traditional Indian music from across the country. Since the institute was shut down and most of the academic activities were put on hold, I used the time to make a music video to showcase the harmony and connection among various music traditions belonging to different cultures of India. The students who stayed back cooperated. It was shot entirely on the campus hostel premises with all the lockdown related guidelines being followed,” said Tivakaran.

The video features four anthological segments, each dedicated to Tamil, Malayalee, Bengali and Marathi cultures respectively.

“In all four segments, traditional music practices which have percussion-based music instruments such as drum, dhol, dhaak or any other such instrument as a centrepiece have been used,” he said.

The Malayalam segment is based on Thrissur Pooram performance, a festival that is celebrated every year on the day of Pooram.

“We have used the audio clip recorded by veteran sound engineer Resul Pookutty for in the film “The Sound Story” (directed by Prasad Prabhakar). Resul as well was the director and producer of the film were kind enough to allow the clip to be used for the music video project,” said Tivakaran.

The Bengali segment features folk music and dance traditions from North Bengal while the Marathi segment is based on the Ganpati dhol-tasha performances which are carried out as processions during the Ganesh Utsav in Maharashtra.

"Tamil Nadu unit of the BJP seems to be in a dilemma over E V Ramasamy. The question seems to be — whether to openly accept some of the principles for which Periyar, as he is popularly known, stood for — even while vehemently opposing his stand on God.

After taking head on the ideologies of the social reformer Periyar for years to build its vote bank by consolidating Hindu votes, the recent overtures — by BJP state president L Murugan towards Periyar — seem to have placed the party at a crossroads. Whatever be the reasons, Murugan’s praise for the social reformer’s principles, barring the one against Hinduism and its beliefs, have rattled a section of saffron party leaders and supporters.

It started with a ‘pointed question’ from the media, on September 17, when Murugan was addressing the press after celebrating Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s 70th birthday at the party headquarters in Chennai. A journalist asked him whether he would also greet Periyar on his 142nd birth anniversary. Incidentally, Periyar and Modi share their birthdays. ""He (Periyar) was a social reformer. We have no objection in expressing our greetings,"" Murugan had responded. In a separate development, on the same day, the party’s recently appointed vice-president K Annamalai advised party workers from addressing the social reformer as ‘Thanthai Periyar’, just as the Dravidian parties fondly addressed E V Ramasamy. ""Thanthai Periyar fought for social justice and for the downtrodden. Can’t say it better than this,"" Annamalai tweeted, tagging Murugan.

The whole issue would have ended there, had Murugan not commented again on Periyaar a couple of days later at Villupuram. ""Periyar has done a lot of social reforms. We will accept Periyar’s good principles. But, he said there is no God and we cannot accept that,"" Murugan replied, once again to a question.

""There is a difference between making a statement and responding to a ‘pointed’ question. As usual, the media is twisting it,"" said BJP spokesman Narayanan Thirupathy. According to him, the year 1925 was significant as sections of people came out of the Congress movement to chalk out their own political course. ""Both RSS and Periyar fought for social justice. But the ideologies of the two can never meet nor travel together,"" he said. ""While everyone works for the betterment of society in his or her own way, we have our own leaders and their contributions to the development of our society to talk about,"" Narayanan said.

But Murugan’s recent directive to the state unit’s IT wing — not to post tweets criticising Periyar — seems to have driven a wedge among party functionaries. ""We will not accept Periyar and his ideologies at any cost,"" said state president of BJP’s IT wing C T R Nirmal Kumar, who refused to confirm any such directive from Murugan. ""We are not for animosity against anyone and there is no need to hurt leaders, especially those who are no longer there. When saffron water was poured on a Periyar statue sometime back, we all criticised it,"" Thirupathy said.

BJP general secretary Karu Nagarajan felt there is nothing wrong in agreeing to the views expressed by the state president (on Periyar). ""He reflects the party stand and it is not wrong to accept good principles,"" he said. But in the same vein, Nagarajan feels that it is time to look beyond Periyar.

""Times have changed. Today’s generation is fully tuned into the digital era. No one is opposing a widow’s remarriage. Girls are performing better than boys in public exams consistently. While we cannot ever accept his stand on God and the bashing of one community, most other principles of his have been accepted by all,"" he said.

There is a concentrated move by the party high command to shift the BJP’s narrative in Tamil Nadu to enhance its reach to a larger support base. ""It would be youth-centric and positive in approach. In this, personal attacks and demeaning of political leaders and icons like Periyar do not have any place,"" said a senior BJP leader close to Murugan and Annamalai.

Political critic Kolahala Srenivaas feels the BJP’s state leaders are embracing Periyar for popular politics to appease the masses, without understanding the core ideology of the party. ""It will neither help the party to sustain their inherent vote bank nor expand it,"" he said. While Periyar coined ‘Dravidianism’ as a concept to whip up regional feelings and against the concept of India, it was diagonally opposite to the BJP’s core ideology of nationalism, he said.

Others, however, differ. ""It is good that BJP has understood the importance of Periyar in Tamil Nadu and his impact on the state’s politics. Murugan’s statements (on Periyar) are toeing the line of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who often praises Dr Ambedkar. By criticising a mass leader like Periyar, the BJP was distancing itself from Tamil Nadu voters. By recognising him (Periyar), Murugan has made a welcome move and a right approach that could help them gain ground in the state,"" said political analyst M Kasinathan.

CHENNAI: Ahead of the Tamil Nadu assembly election, the BJP high command is searching for an “ideal leader” to guide the state unit with strategies that would give the party the much-needed fillip to expand its base in the Dravidian turf and act as a bridge with the central leadership.

A highly placed source said BJP national general secretary Muralidhar Rao , who is in-charge of Tamil Nadu for more than eight years, is likely to be replaced by October-end. Party national general secretary Ram Madhav and national secretary Sunil V Deodhar are said to be frontrunners for the post. Both are known for their aggressive poll strategies, the source said.

“Ram Madhav is familiar with the two Dravidian parties and the state politics. He played a vital role in strengthening the BJP in the eastern part of the country. If he is made TN in-charge, it will help the party strike a formidable alliance and get a good number of seats along with the regional parties. He enjoys the trust of the national leaders too,” said the source.

Like him, Sunil Deodhar is known as a shrewd strategist. He was assigned tasks in difficult political situations on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s instructions and proved his mettle, point out senior BJP leaders. Deodhar was in-charge of Modi’s Varanasi constituency in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and was later assigned to Tripura where the BJP won the assembly election.

Though many consider this a regular exercise, the need to replace Muralidhar Rao is being considered as, under his guidance, the party failed to make gains in Tamil Nadu and did not witness much growth.

“He failed to instill confidence among the party functionaries in the past eight years. The replacement will be a welcome move,” said a state leader, preferring anonymity. Citing the 2016 assembly election as an example, he added that the party went alone and many BJP candidates polled less than even NOTA. “Again in 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the Centre assigned the task of holding seat sharing talks with allies to Piyush Goyal and C T Ravi. Rao was kept out of it,” he said. The party leadership was considering a few other national-level leaders such as G V L Narasimha Rao and Y Satya Kumar, who is the national secretary of the party, for the post, the source said.

"Chennai: Unconvinced with the reasons cited for the assembly ’s second attempt to initiate privilege proceedings against DMK chief M K Stalin and 17 of his party MLAs, the Madras high court stayed the notices issued by the privilege committee. The 18 faced the impugned proceedings for having gutka packets inside the House in 2017 to highlight easy availability of the banned material.

Citing the first bench order in this regard when the notices issued first, Justice Puspha Sathyanarayana said: “It is to be stated that the first bench of this court has already adjudicated the issue of showcause notice in the given circumstances and held that the same suffered from a foundational error of assuming the conduct of the petitioners to be prohibited.”

“The present notices are also issued on the same ground except stating that the permission of the speaker was not obtained before bringing in the banned/ prohibited gutka sachets. The question of permission of the speaker cannot be decided independently and the same can be decided only in the context of breach of privilege,” Justice Pushpa Sathyanarayana said.

Refusing to concur with the contention of advocate-general Vijay Narayanan that there is no urgency for passing an interim order on Thursday, the judge said: “As the petitioners have made out a prima facie case and the balance of convenience is in their favour, this court is of the view that the notices need to be stayed until further orders.” She then adjourned the hearing to October 28.

On August 25, the first bench of the court headed by Chief Justice A P Sahi set aside the earlier notices issued against the MLAs due to ‘foundational error’.

On September 7, the committee issued fresh notices to the 18 MLAs as the first bench granted liberty to the committee to commence the proceedings afresh if it feels so. Aggrieved, the MLAs moved the high court once again.

Passing the interim order, the judge said, “…the division bench also had specifically given a finding that the possession of the banned items as per the notification per se will not amount to a breach, like possession of narcotic drugs or banned liquor bottles, etc.” As the declaration and final determination of the rights are already concluded by this court, it amounts to reopening of the issue. However, the same requires factual adjudication and till such conclusion is arrived at, the proceedings against the petitioners pursuant to the fresh showcause notices cannot be allowed to go on, the court said.

AHMEDABAD: After a 14-year-old mother, who has learning difficulties, could not tell police who her rapist was, the court ordered the investigator to trace the culprit using medical evidence after getting DNA samples of the newborn analysed at the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL).

Not only could the girl not help investigators in tracing her rapist, her mother and two siblings were also helpless because they also suffer from learning difficulties.

The case is from Gandhinagar district. The rape survivor is mentally unsound. When her health deteriorated in May, her father took her to the Civil Hospital, where she was found to be seven months pregnant. The administration got into action and the Child Welfare Committee ordered to immediately send her to a women protection home in Rajkot and her medical treatment began. A criminal investigation was also launched with the registration of an FIR at Mansa police station under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (Pocso) against an unknown person.

Two months passed and the investigation to find the rapist did not yield results. The survivor is in no position to communicate anything. Psychiatrists said she is unable to understand language and also language. The family were of little help because her mother and two brothers also suffer from mental disability and were in no position to communicate with the cops in this regard. The victim’s father did not name a suspect.

The police also inquired with relatives living in the neighbourhood, but they were also ignorant of the offence.

Finally, two months later, the police inspector approached the special Pocso court requesting it to accept an ‘A summary’ in the case because the investigation made no headway.

Meanwhile, the victim delivered a baby girl on August 4. The investigator told the court that DNA samples of the victim and the baby girl were collected and sent to the FSL. Last week, special Pocso judge K M Sojitra accepted the summary but directed the officer to carry out an effective scientific investigation using DNA samples to find the accused person.

AHMEDABAD: Furious with a lawyer for his smoking during virtual court proceedings, the Gujarat high court on Thursday imposed a fine of Rs 10,000 on him and deprecated his “irresponsible conduct”.

The case involved advocate J V Ajmera, who was attending the court proceeding in a bail matter from inside his car. During the hearing that was taking place through video conference, advocate Ajmera was seen smoking. This upset Justice A S Supehia, who said, “It was not expected from an advocate to be smoking in the car during the court proceedings. Such behaviour of the advocate is required to be strictly condemned. The advocates appearing through video conference are required to maintain minimum dignified decorum so that the majesty and dignity of the proceedings as well as the Institution are maintained.”

The high court has said that henceforth the lawyers should stay either at their residences or at their offices while addressing the court on video conference, and they should sit properly. The HC has also directed the Bar Council of Gujarat and the Bar Association of high court to instruct all lawyers for this and also to order them to behave in a dignified manner.

The high court has ordered the registrar (judicial) to initiate proceedings against advocate Ajmera and sought a report within 10 days. The court has further ordered the registry to send the report to the Bar Council. Justice Supehia asked the council and the association to maintain decorum before court during video conferencing.

“They shall be informed/instructed that the proceedings conducted through video conferencing shall be either from their respective residences or any office space, barring any vehicle or any open ground. While attending the proceedings from their respective residences/offices, they shall also maintain appropriate sitting posture while addressing the court,” the court order reads.

AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court quashed an FIR against four persons including the principal of Bhuj college after they struck a compromise with the students in the matter of the stripping of 66 girl students to check if they were menstruating.

Besides the compromise between the accused and students, the HC also said that the offences alleged were not so serious that the HC may not use its discretion to quash the FIR.

The incident had taken place at the Shree Sahajanand Girls Institute in Bhuj and police arrested four persons – the college principal Rita Raninga, institute coordinator Anita Chauhan, the girls’ hostel supervisor Ramila Hirani and a peon, Naina Gorasia.

The arrests took place after a furore when news of the undressing of the girls came into the public domain. Members of the National Commission of Women came down and an SIT was formed to investigate the issue. However, six months later, the student who had taken the initiative to lodge an FIR against the four for discrimination against menstruating girls and for making them take off their clothes, settled the dispute with them and filed an affidavit in the high court to support the quashing petition filed by the four accused.

The student partly blamed the media for the registration of the FIR. She stated, “...the dispute cropped up owing to heated media intervention and also chaos created in the campus. The quarrel between the complainant and the present applicants has been resolved amicably with the intervention of the family members of the students and after being given the complete understanding of the set of facts, the informant and other girls understood the entire incident in its proper sense and hence the applicants have no protest if the impugned FIR is quashed.”

Justice A C Joshi quashed the FIR observing, “It would be a futile exercise if the trial shall take place and the purpose of the same would not be served and therefore in humble view of this court, it would be just and proper to quash the aforesaid FIR.”

In quashing the FIR, the court said, “The offences are not so grave which invite the latest law of the land that whenever there is serious offence, in that case, the high court may not exercise discretion under Section 482 of the CrPC, but in the present case, the offences are less serious in nature.”

"Sedentary lifestyle of

tribal teens

AHMEDABAD: Obesity , Type-2 diabetes and bad cholesterols, all hallmarks of poor lifestyle associated with rapid urbanization, are invading tribal communities in Gujarat .Alarmingly, its early signs are visible in tribals as young as 14 to 19. In a first-ofits-kind study of community-based metabolic syndrome disorder — lifestyle diseases — among tribals, Delhi University anthropologists studied Kukana tribals of Valsad to flag an emerging public health issue among tribals as they urbanize. The study was published in Elsevier’s Journal of diabetes and metabolic syndrome published in June this year.The study monitored the health of 296 young tribal boys (128) and girls (168) for almost a year beginning 2018. Overall prevalence of all three metabolic syndrome parameters was found at 3.8% in the group. Gender wise, the prevalence was 3.9% and 3.6% in boys and girls respectively.When individual parameters were considered, low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) or good cholesterol was the most prevalent individual risk factor observed at 64.9% in the study.This is significant as HDL levels are elevated if regular exercise is part of daily life which indicates that like their urban counterparts, tribal teens may be becoming more sedentary. Similarly, prevalence of high blood pressure was higher in males (20.3%) than females (14.3%).Furthermore, fasting blood sugar was prevalent in 10% males and 10% females. Both central obesity and hyperglyceridemia was found more in females. Central obesity was present in 8.6% of males and 10.7% females., while hypertriglyceridemia was found in 11% females as compared to 8.6% males.The study population was taken from two villages — Barumal and Sidhumbar — and two towns of Udvada and Asura in Valsad district. The researchers, doctoral fellow Nupur Mahajan, and retired professor Gautam Kshatriya of the department of anthropology at University of Delhi, said that they had noticed children enjoyed eating cheap and oily processed packaged snacks which were available at stalls put up outside schools. Traditionally, the tribal food basket includes cereals like jowar, nagli, wal, rice, and tuwar. The blood parameters were measured as per the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP)-Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III guidelines.Another interesting observation made by Mahajan was that at least 51% children measured for at least one of the three risk factors for metabolic syndrome disorder, 17.6% teenage children had measured for two risk factors while 3.7% measured for all three risk factors. Kukanas are typically agriculturalist, but due to limitation of land resources they often engage in agricultural labour, daily wage and casual labour work.","Urban health ills catching up with tribal teens in Gujarat, says study"
"AHMEDABAD: Rajya Sabha MP and senior group president, Reliance Industries Limited (RIL), Parimal Nathwani, has hailed the appointment of IPS officer Deepan Bhadran as Jamnagar district superintendent of police (SP).

Terming Bhadran’s appointment as a “special mission to curb and control criminals and their political masters with firm hands ,” Nathwani tweeted on Thursday saying, “Your posting here will give a great relief to the law abiding citizens, land owners , builders, businessmen, traders and factory owners of the area.”

In a series of three tweets, Nathwani said, “I am sure the dynamic and bold SP @BhadranDeepan with a special mission will curb and control criminals & their political masters with firm hands.” He tagged PM Modi, Union home minister Amit Shah, CMO, MOS home Pradipsinh Jadeja, and the DGP in his tweets.

The Times of India had recently reported that Bhadran has been entrusted with the task of putting a leash to the growing notoriety of gangster Jayesh Patel who has unleashed a wave of terror in Jamnagar.

“I was referring to Jayesh Patel in my tweets. Never before has Jamnagar witnessed this level of extortion and land-grabbing. Some politicians of the ruling party are also directly or indirectly involved,” Nathwani told TOI on Thursday.

He added that the entire Jamnagar is under threat from the criminal. “No builder, contractor, businessman, nobody is safe. Anybody who is doing business gets a threat call from Jayesh Patel from abroad, seeking money. This is about extortion, black money and land-grabbing,” Nathwani said.

In his tweets, Nathwani also hinted at suspicion over involvement of range IG Sandeep Singh in settling cases in favour of criminals. “While new #Jamnagar SP @BhadranDeepan will use his brilliance and firm hands on criminals, some people suspect, I don’t know true or false, that Range IG Sandip Singh in past settled some cases in favour of criminals in tune with some politicians,"" said Nathwani on twitter.

When TOI contacted Rajkot range IG Sandeep Singh for his comment on Parimal Nathwani's tweets, he said: ""I have no comment, I just want to say we are taking strict action against anti-social elements and we will continue to do so.""

Jayesh Patel, who is known to allegedly have the blessings of a turncoat minister in the Rupani cabinet, aims to become the next Vishal Goswami. Senior police officials say Patel is an accused in 41 criminal cases including murder, extortion and land-grabbing.

This is the first time the Gujarat assembly instituted the ‘Best MLA’ award. In February this year, the speaker had announced the setting up of a committee to select the best MLA based on 19 criteria.

Rathwa, the MLA from Chhota Udepur, is the longest serving MLA in the Gujarat assembly. Since 1972, he has contested 11 assembly elections and won all of them except the one held in the backdrop of the 2002 communal riots in Gujarat. “Let us all strive and work together to serve people better,” Rathwa said while thanking the members for the award. Chudasama, the MLA from Dholka, said, “The RSS has played a major role in shaping my life, which began in 1967. This is a recognition of 53 years of work. I also want to thank everyone in the assembly for this award,” he said. The selection committee formed to choose the best MLA include the speaker as chairman, the CM, deputy CM, leader of opposition, parliamentary affairs ministers of both cabinet and MoS rank, chief whips of the ruling and opposition party and the deputy leader of opposition. The criteria for choosing the best MLA included knowledge of parliamentary laws and practices and obedience to them, awareness of issues of public interest, ability to effectively represent peoples’ issues, conduct in public life, assistance in smooth operations of the assembly, attendance in the assembly and meetings of its committees and the like.

"Ahmedabad: All India Congress Committee Gujarat in-charge Rajeev Satav alleged in Ahmedabad on Thursday that the central government wants a handful of industrialists to enjoy control over farming in the country. Speaking to the media at the state Congress headquarters, Satav said that by introducing three laws related to farming, the central government has caused huge damage to farmers’ interests in the country.

Satav said that the new bill introduced by the central government has no mention of minimum support price and farmers are being misled by the BJP that they will get better prices for their produce. “Like airports and ports, the government is handing over farming to industrialists. Farmers will suffer because of the new farming laws and that is why the Congress and 12 other parties are opposing the law,” Satav said.

GPCC president Amit Chavda said that a series of protest programmes will be organized across the state against the new laws. “Farmers’ organizations and Congress workers will launch the `Speak Up for Farmers’ campaign in social media on September 26. On September 28, Congress workers and leaders will march to the governor’s house to submit a memorandum opposing the new farm laws,” Chavda said.

AHMEDABAD: In a daring operation, two teams of the city cyber cell entered Naxal affected areas in Jharkhand dressed as tourists and held three persons on Tuesday, one from Giridh and two from Jamtara . The accused ran a racket of cheating people by scaring them over phone and convincing them to part with credit card details to purportedly update their e-wallet ‘know your customer’ (KYC) data. After learning details, they used to steal money from the credit cards or e-wallet linked bank accounts.

In connection with the racket, one Gausulvara Ansari was also arrested from Maninagar, Ahmedabad on Tuesday. Ansari hails from Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh.

Investigators said the operations in Jharkhand and Ahmedabad were carried out on the same day so the crooks didn’t have time to warn each other.

With the help of local police in Jharkhand, city cybercrime officials arrested Shivkumar Anandprasad Gupta from Giridih and Ajay and Kundan Mandal from Jamtara. The mastermind of the racket, Govind Mandal, is still at large.

Cybercrime officials said Ansari and Gupta are currently in their custody, while Ajay and Kundan Mandal are being interrogated in Jamtara by their team.

Bhatia said the RT-PCR test takes a longer time and for that period the accused has to be kept at the police station. “The law says that the accused should be produced in court within 24 hours of being held. That is why we have opted for Rapid Antigen Tests. It gives instant results and so the accused can be produced before the court in time.

"The doctors’ association also asked the state government to strenghten Covid treatment in other districts

AHMEDABAD: One day after TOI reported that 443 patients from outside the city — 145 from other states and 298 from other districts — were being getting treated at AMC-designated Covid-19 hospitals , the Ahmedabad Medical Association (AMA) wrote to Gujarat CM Vijay Rupani saying local patients should be given precedence at city hospitals given the current circumstances.

The doctors’ body also requested the state government to strengthen Covid-19 treatment in other districts.

‘On a daily basis for the last three weeks around 200-250 patients from states like Rajasthan, MP, etc. are being admitted to private designated Covid hospitals in Ahmedabad. This results in restricting access for residents of Ahmedabad due to non-availability of beds,’ read the letter.

AMA also raised the issue of ‘more than 400 patients’ from other districts of Gujarat being treated at city hospitals. ‘It would be advisable in the first phase to restrict admissions of out of state patients in Ahmedabad private hospitals for Covid treatment. A suitable decision for other district patients of Gujarat can be taken at the appropriate time,’ said the letter.

Dr Mona Desai, president of AMA, told TOI that they do not intend to create us-vs-they scenario. “The idea is to strengthen infrastructure for Covid-19 elsewhere so the burden on the city is reduced. City hospitals treat patients from across the globe – but for past fortnight, we have been seeing a shortage of beds for Covid-19 patients and thought of raising the issue,” she said.

Several hospitals in the city in the past week recorded over 75% occupancy in beds with oxygen dependency and ICUs. “In absolute numbers, there is no scarcity of beds – but when patients need a hospital near home or a specific hospitals, availability could be an issue,” said a hospital administrator.

"Ahmedabad: The pharmaceutical sector in the country is set to emerge more or less unscathed from the Covid-19 pandemic this fiscal. The sector is expected to post 8-9% growth in fiscal 2021 on the back of higher exports, states a report by the rating agency Crisil.

The size of the Indian pharmaceutical market is close to Rs 3 lakh crore with export and domestic sales having equal share. Gujarat accounts for almost one third of the total pharma production in India.

According to the report, the export growth is estimated at 11-12% this fiscal as against 10% last year. The exports will outpace domestic market growth, which is expected to be 5-6% as compared to 10% in financial year 2020. As a result, overall growth of the pharmaceutical sector in India is likely to be 8-9%, which will be 1.5% lower than the previous year.

“Higher exports should offset some of the reduction in domestic formulation sales because of pandemic-led disruptions, especially in the acute therapies segment,” said Tanvi Shah, associate director, CRISIL Ratings.

The report further added that the operating profitability for 350 CRISIL-rated pharmaceutical companies, representing 70% of sector revenue, would soften a bit but remain healthy at 19% despite higher input prices. Credit profiles will continue to be supported by healthy balance sheets.

The export pie is divided into regulated markets such as the US and Europe (45% share in exports), rest of world (ROW) markets (35%) and bulk drugs (20%). “Exports growth is expected to remain strong at 10% and above in each of the segments,” the agency added.

Stating that India accounted for almost half of the new drug applications approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) since 2019, Isha Chaudhary, director, Crisil Research, added, “This strong pipeline, coupled with lower import alerts and warning letters in recent months, should ensure a steady pace of new launches, which will help sustain export momentum to regulated markets.”

"Ahmedabad: Petroleum dealers across Gujarat will not buy fuel from oil marketing companies on Tuesday, September 29. According to an announcement by the Federation of Gujarat Petroleum Dealers’ Association (FGPDA) on Thursday, the decision was taken to protest towards the alleged inaction of oil companies over the illegal sale of spurious biodiesel across the state.

“Sale of spurious biodiesel is illegal and despite us repeatedly raising the issue with oil companies over the past year and a half, no action has been taken. What is sold in the name of biodiesel is cheaper than diesel cost and causes damage to vehicles. Despite a slew of representations no action was taken. On September 29, petroleum dealers across the state will not buy petrol or diesel from these companies as a mark of protest,” said Arvind Thakkar, president, FGPDA.

Thakkar clarified that sale of petrol and diesel at all dealerships will continue as usual across the state. Concerns have been raised over a possible shortage of fuel at petroleum dealerships in Gujarat due to no procurement for a day. However, senior FGPDA officials said all dealerships will procure more fuel a day or two in advance to meet demand.

The association put its average monthly pre-Covid sales at 23 crore litres of petrol and 55 crore litres of diesel across Gujarat. Consumption levels are now much lower due to the pandemic.

FGPDA members also warned that if no action is taken by oil companies or the state government against the alleged illegal sale of biodiesel, the petroleum dealers will continue to boycott purchases twice a week i.e. on Tuesdays and Fridays.

NEW DELHI: Google on Friday denied the claims made in certain media reports that its Google Pay app is sharing Indian customers' transaction data with third parties.

Citing an affidavit filed before a bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan in Delhi High Court, a section of the media said that Google has told the court that it is allowed to share customers transaction data with third parties with the prior permission of the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) and payment service providing (PSP) banks.

The affidavit was filed in response to a public interest litigation (PIL) seeking action against Google Pay for allegedly violating the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) guidelines related to data storage and sharing.

""This is to clarify that press reports on the basis of the affidavit filed by Google before the Delhi High Court, do not represent the complete facts,"" a Google spokesperson said in a statement.

""We would like to put it on record that Google Pay is in full compliance with Unified Payment Interface (UPI) procedural guidelines, issued by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) and the applicable laws and does not share customer transaction data with any third party outside the payments flow,"" the company spokesperson added.

The high court has listed the matter for hearing on November 10. Earlier this week, Google Pay in collaboration with Visa and banking partners rolled out tokenisation across its platform, enabling users to safely transact with their cards and use Tap-to-pay feature on near-field communication (NFC)-enabled point of sale (POS) terminals and online merchants.

The feature is now available to users of Axis and SBI Card, with Kotak and more banks expected to follow suit very soon.

With tokenisation, Google Pay Android users can use their debit or credit card to make payments through a secure digital token attached to their phone without having to physically share their credit or debit card details.

NEW DELHI: India's efforts to privatise refiner Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd could spill over into the next fiscal year, according to a government document and sources, hurting New Delhi's efforts to rein in a ballooning fiscal deficit.

The privatisation of key companies, including BPCL, is a key part of government plans to pare the fiscal deficit, which has breached its target level just four months into the current fiscal year. Industry sources last year estimated the government's 53.29% stake in BPCL could fetch $8 billion to $10 billion.

With India's economy contracting by a record 23.9% in the June quarter due to Covid-19, a delayed sale of BPCL could hinder the government's ability to generate funds for stimulus efforts aimed at restoring growth.

New Delhi's plan to sell its stake in BPCL was first announced in November 2019, and is part of a broader program to spin off or sell stakes in dozens of state-owned companies.

The sale has been targeted for completion in the current fiscal year at end-March, but the deadline for initial expressions of interest was pushed out by two months due to pandemic-related movement restrictions that have prevented potential buyers from inspecting the facility.

A sale status report issued last month and reviewed by Reuters showed the sale was only due to complete the third step of a 25-step process established for government divestments this month. The document suggests it could take as long as another 21 months for the sale to be completed, although some stages could be carried out concurrently. Potential buyers still needed to attain security clearance, conduct valuation assessments and agree financial terms.

""This looks challenging. But we are doing our best to complete the transaction in this financial year,"" a senior government official familiar with the sale told Reuters.

A second official said the process could take at least 7-8 months more, which would delay completion until at least the end of April, and mean that the proceeds of any sale would only hit government coffers next fiscal year, which begins on April 1

""It may not be possible for overseas companies to do due diligence as air travel is restricted,"" added a third official involved in the privatisation process.

All three officials declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue.

The sale also faces domestic opposition. The state government of Kerala, where BPCL's 310,000 barrels per day Kochi refinery is located, fears job losses and plans to challenge the privatisation in the Supreme Court, its industry minister EP Jayarajan told Reuters.

Companies including Saudi Aramco and Rosneft have indicated they would look at BPCL since the privatisation plan was announced.

BPCL shares have fallen more than 20% since November last year. Interest may be dampened as the industry looks to shift to greener energy investments.

The government had budgeted collections of over $27 billion from privatisations and minority stake sales of state-owned companies this fiscal year, but had raised only about $775 million after the first 6 months.

We initially focused on increased risk management, balance sheet protection, and building out new initiatives that would set us up for growth, post lockdown. Our underwriting and collections capabilities got battle-tested during the lockdown. The company's tech and data intensity allowed us to serve customers in a smarter, more efficient manner. All of this, combined with a smart and unique capital strategy plus diversified banking partnerships, gave us the confidence of recovery and growth. We are now positioned well for scaling up the business in a post-lockdown world.

What are the plans to overcome the slowdown?

Pre-COVID we were doing Rs 2,500 crore per year disbursement, and growing 4x year on year. Owing to consumer sentiments around an economic slowdown, this came down, but then we are back to doing over 60% of our pre-COVID numbers and soon we expect to be at 100% by the festive season at the end of this year. Thereafter, it’s going to be a strong growth trajectory, fuelled by everything that we’ve built out in the past six to nine months, combined with a strong balance sheet.

We’re focused on serving our customers and in enhancing the product offerings so that we can add more value to people’s financial lives according to their needs. There are a lot of exciting innovations in the pipeline in areas of data science, engineering, operations and customer experience management, which will enable us to foster growth and go after an increased market share.

We are also venturing into new lending categories and strategic partnerships to cater to newer segments with consumer financing, 0% interest EMIs, small-ticket personal loans, etc.

Why are you venturing into use-case based lending? Any particular customer feedback that led you towards the same?

On one hand, our customers want affordable instant EMI options , especially for high-value use cases such as education, healthcare and auto purchase. The need for affordable EMI is higher in a post-COVID hit world as households are going through income shock.

On the other hand, merchants want to increase their sales conversions as they see affordability as a key lever for driving sales. Hence, this was the perfect time to launch a category like use case lending - our customers were already taking flexible cash from MoneyTap credit line for a few specific use cases like education, healthcare and auto purchase.

How is the electric vehicle segment as a potential lending category?

India’s EV potential is estimated to be an Rs 500 billion opportunity by 2025 (basis current EV penetration). From a customer standpoint, EVs offer low operating expenses but have a high initial cost, and that's where new-age fintech players have the opportunity to capture the market early on by offering affordable solutions like 0% EMI. We've recently launched this category with BGauss and will be adding new partners in the category soon.

What do you think is the market potential in the next two years?

The household debt to GDP is still very low in India (~10%). Credit cards are very under-penetrated and very costly in case you can't pay back or need cash. Post moratorium, lending needs to be central to the recovery, across the board (SME, MSME, consumer lending). We are well-positioned to ride through this storm, having recently raised funds. We have enough runway, strategic tie-ups with capital partners who are ready to lend and confident that our credit line product works.

PENINSULAR MALAYSIA: An invisible workforce of millions of labourers from some of the poorest corners of Asia toil in the palm oil industry, many of them enduring various forms of exploitation, with the most serious abuses including child labour, outright slavery and allegations of rape, an Associated Press investigation has found.

In Malaysia and Indonesia , these workers tend the heavy reddish-orange palm oil fruit that makes its way into the supply chains of many iconic food and cosmetics companies like Unilever, L'Oreal, Nestle and Procter & Gamble.

Together, the two countries produce about 85% of the world's estimated $65 billion palm oil supply.

Palm oil is virtually impossible to avoid. Often disguised on labels as an ingredient listed by more than 200 names, it can be found in roughly half the products on supermarket shelves and in most cosmetic brands. It's contained in paints, plywood, pesticides and pills. It's also present in animal feed, biofuels and even hand sanitizer.

The AP interviewed nearly 130 current and former workers from two dozen palm oil companies who came from eight countries and laboured on plantations across wide swaths of Malaysia and Indonesia. Almost all had complaints against their treatment, with some saying they were cheated, threatened, held against their will or forced to work off unsurmountable debts. Others said they were regularly harassed by authorities, swept up in raids and detained in crowded government facilities.

They included members of Myanmar 's long-persecuted Rohingya Muslim minority, who fled ethnic cleansing in their homeland only to be sold into the palm oil industry. Fishermen who escaped years of slavery on boats also described coming ashore in search of help, only to be trafficked onto plantations -- sometimes with police involvement. They said they worked for little or no pay and were trapped for years.

The AP used the most recently published data from producers, traders and buyers of the world's most-consumed vegetable oil, as well as US Customs records, to link the labourers' palm oil and its derivatives from the mills that process it to the supply chains of top Western companies like the makers of Oreo cookies, Lysol cleaners and some of Hershey's chocolatey treats.

AP reporters witnessed some abuses firsthand and reviewed police reports, complaints made to labour unions, videos and photos smuggled out of plantations and local media stories to corroborate accounts wherever possible. In some cases, reporters tracked down people who helped enslaved workers escape. More than a hundred rights advocates, academics, clergy members, activists and government officials also were interviewed.

Though labour issues have largely been ignored, the punishing effects of palm oil on the environment have been decried for years. Still, giant Western financial institutions like JPMorgan Chase, Deutsche Bank and the Vanguard Group have continued to help fuel a crop that has exploded globally, soaring from just 5 million tons in 1999 to 72 million tons today, according to the US Department of Agriculture.

Sometimes they invest directly but, increasingly, third parties are used like Malaysia-based Malayan Banking Berhad, or Maybank, one of the world's biggest palm oil financiers. It not only provides capital to growers but, in some cases, processes the plantations' payrolls, with arbitrary and inconsistent wage deductions that are considered indicators of forced labour.

""This has been the industry's hidden secret for decades,"" said Gemma Tillack of the US-based Rainforest Action Network, which has exposed labour abuses on palm oil plantations. ""The buck stops with the banks. It is their funding that makes this system of exploitation possible.""

The AP found widespread labour abuses on plantations big and small, including some that meet certification standards set by the global Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, an association that promotes ethical production - including labour practices -- and whose members include growers, buyers, traders and environmental watchdogs.

Some of the same companies that display the RSPO's green palm logo signifying its seal of approval have been accused of continuing to grab land from indigenous people and destroying virgin rainforests that are home to orangutans and other critically endangered species.

As global demand for palm oil surges, plantations are struggling to find enough labourers, frequently relying on brokers who prey on the most at-risk people. Many foreign workers end up fleeced by a syndicate of recruiters and corrupt officials and often are unable to speak the local language, rendering them especially susceptible to trafficking and other abuses.

They sometimes pay up to $5,000 just to get their jobs - an amount that could take years to earn in their home countries _ often showing up for work already crushed by debt. Many have their passports seized by company officials to keep them from running away, which the United

Nations recognizes as a potential flag of forced labour.

Countless others remain off the books, including migrants working without documentation and children who AP reporters witnessed squatting in the fields like crabs, picking up loose fruit alongside their parents. Many women also work for free or on a day-to-day basis, earning the equivalent of as little as $2 a day, sometimes for decades.

The AP talked to some female workers who said they were sexually harassed and even raped in the fields, including some minors.

The workers AP interviewed came from Indonesia, Malaysia, Bangladesh, India, Nepal, the Philippines and Cambodia, along with Myanmar, which represents the newest army of exploited labourers. The AP is not fully identifying them or their plantations to protect their safety.

""We work until we are dying,"" said one worker sitting in a room with two other colleagues at a Malaysian plantation run by Felda, a government-owned company. Their eyes filled with tears after learning Felda was one of the world's largest palm oil producers.

""They use this palm oil to make all these products,"" he said. ""It makes us very sad.""

The Malaysian government was contacted by the AP repeatedly over the course of a week, but issued no comment. Felda also did not respond, but its commercial arm, FGV Holdings Berhad, said it had been working to address workers' complaints, including making improvements in recruitment practices and ensuring that foreign labourers have access to their passports.

Nageeb Wahab, head of the Malaysian Palm Oil Association, a government-supported umbrella group, called the allegations against the industry unwarranted: ""All of them are not true,"" he said.

The Indonesian Palm Oil Association said it has been striving to improve labour conditions for the last five years. Soes Hindharno, spokesman for the country's Ministry of Manpower and Transmigration, said any company violating government rules and regulations on serious issues like child labour and not paying women workers could face sanctions, including having their operations shut down.

Unilever, L'Oreal, Nestle and Procter & Gamble all said they do not tolerate human rights abuses and investigate allegations raised about companies that feed into their supply chains, taking appropriate action when warranted, which can include working with suppliers to improve conditions or suspending relationships when grievances are not properly addressed.

Deutsche Bank reiterated its support of human rights, Vanguard said it monitors companies in its portfolio for abuses, and JPMorgan Chase declined comment.

Maybank expressed surprise at the criticism of its standards, saying that ""we reject any insinuation that Maybank may be involved in any unethical behavior.""

WASHINGTON: The Trump administration on Thursday proposed a fixed time limit on visas of students, researchers and foreign journalists in the United States, noting that it is concerned about the liberal existing visa programme being abused and a potential for increased risk to national security.

The proposal scheduled to be notified in the Federal Register on Friday is not country-specific, but has been brought in view of the abuse of the existing loopholes in the system by China. In all the three categories of foreign students, researchers and journalists, those from China have benefitted the most.

Under the proposed rule, 'F' (students visa) or 'J' (researchers visa) nonimmigrants would be admitted into the US for a period up to the end date of their programme, not to exceed four years.

Foreign nationals from countries associated with high visa overstay rates (rates greater than 10 per cent for student and exchange visitors) will be limited to up to a two-year fixed period of stay to increase monitoring, deter immigration violations and incentivise a timely departure, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said.

Amending the relevant regulations is critical in improving the programme oversight mechanisms, preventing foreign adversaries from exploiting the country's education environment and properly enforcing and strengthening the US immigration laws, Senior Official Performing the Duties of the Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli said.

The duration of stay can be reduced to a maximum of two years of authorised stay in the US if the foreign national is either born or has the citizenship of a country that is on the State Sponsors of Terrorism list.

Separately, the DHS has proposed initially admitting most 'I' nonimmigrants for a period of time necessary to complete the planned activities or assignments consistent with the 'I' classification, not to exceed 240 days. They can be given another extension for a maximum of 240 days, based on the length of the relevant activities. As of now, foreign journalists on 'I' visas have remained in the US for many a times for decades.

Foreign students would now get just 30 days, instead of the existing 60 days, to leave the country, the DHS said. The stakeholders have been given 30 days' time to respond to the notification.

In 2019 alone, there were over 10 lakh admissions in the 'F' status, a dramatic rise from the 263,938 admissions in the 'F' status when the legacy Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) shifted to an unspecified duration of status or D/S admission in 1978.

A similar growth in the 'J' population has also occurred over the past decades. In 2018, there were 611,373 admissions in the 'J' status, up by over 300 per cent from the 141,213 'J' admissions into the US in 1985.

Finally, there were 44,140 admissions for foreign media representatives in the US in 2018, a growth of over 160 per cent from the 16,753 admissions into the country in 1985.

Studying and participating in exchange visitor and academic programmes in the US offer foreign nationals an access to world-renowned faculty, cutting-edge resources, state-of-the-art courses and individualised instructional programmes, the federal notification said.

Similarly, the US fosters an environment that promotes the exchange of ideas and encourages open discussions when there are differences of opinions, which the country also encourages by allowing foreign news and media members the same unimpeded access and opportunity to share in the constitutional freedoms of the press as domestic news and media members.

However, the DHS said the significant increase in the volume of 'F' academic students, 'J' exchange visitors and 'I' foreign information media representatives poses a challenge to its ability to monitor and oversee these categories of nonimmigrants while they are in the US.

During the length of their stay for D/S, a period of admission without a specified end date, these nonimmigrants are not required to have a direct interaction with the DHS except for a few limited instances such as when applying for employment authorisation for optional practical training or for reinstatement if they have failed to maintain the status.

An admission for D/S, in general, does not afford immigration officers enough predetermined opportunities to directly verify that the aliens granted such nonimmigrant statuses are engaging only in those activities that their respective classifications authorise while they are in the US. In turn, this has undermined the DHS's ability to effectively enforce compliance with the statutory inadmissibility grounds related to unlawful presence and created incentives for fraud and abuse.

The DHS said it anticipates that many 'F', 'J' and 'I' nonimmigrants would be able to complete their activities within their periods of admission. However, those who could not generally would be able to request an extension to their period of admission to an immigration officer.

In addition, as proposed, certain categories of foreign nationals would be eligible for shorter periods of admission, based on national security, fraud or overstay concerns, but like all foreigners with fixed admission periods, would have a specific date upon which they would be required to depart the US or would need to apply to the DHS to have their continued eligibility for the 'F', 'J' or 'I' status reviewed by immigration officers.

The DHS believes that this process would help mitigate the risks posed by foreign adversaries who seek to exploit these programmes, said the notification running into 256 pages. Replacing admissions for D/S with admissions for a fixed period of authorised stay is consistent with most other nonimmigrant categories, it added.

The notification said the D/S framework, because it reduces opportunities for a direct vetting of foreign academic students by immigration officers, creates opportunities for foreign adversaries to exploit the F-1 programme and undermine US national security.

An open education environment in the US offers enormous benefits, but it also places research universities and the nation at the risk of economic, academic or military espionage by foreign students.

""Foreign adversaries are using progressively sophisticated and resourceful methods to exploit the US educational environment, including well-documented cases of espionage through the student program,"" it said.

Detecting and deterring emerging threats to US national security posed by adversaries exploiting the F-1 programme requires additional oversight, the notification asserted. Same is the case with research scholars under 'J' visas as well, it said.

BEIJING: TikTok 's owner said on Thursday it has applied for a Chinese technology export license as it tries to complete a deal with Oracle and Walmart to keep the popular video app operating in the United States.

Beijing tightened control over technology exports last month in an effort to gain leverage over Washington's attempt to force an outright sale of TikTok to US owners. The White House says the video service is a security risk because the personal information of its millions of US users could be handed over to Chinese authorities.

US President Donald Trump said this week he would approve a proposed deal in which Oracle Corp and Walmart Inc could initially own a combined 20 per cent of a new US entity, TikTok Global . Trump said Oracle must have “total control.”

ByteDance said it applied to the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Commerce for an export license and was awaiting a reply. The one-sentence statement gave no other details.

Chinese authorities have not indicated whether they will agree to a transfer of technology. But official newspapers criticised the proposed deal this week as bullying and extortion.

“China has no reason to give the green light to such a deal, which is dirty and unfair,” said the newspaper China Daily on Wednesday.

On Thursday, the foreign ministry said China will “take necessary measures” to safeguard its companies but gave no indication what steps it can take to affect TikTok's fate in the United States.

A ministry spokesman, Wang Wenbin, called on Washington to “respect the principles of market economy and fair competition” and “provide an open, fair, just and non-discriminatory business environment” for foreign companies.

NEW YORK: Major automakers Tesla, Volvo, Ford and Mercedes-Benz have sued the US government over tariffs on Chinese goods , demanding customs duties paid on imports be returned, with interest.

The lawsuits, which were filed in recent days in the New York-based Court of International Trade, concern tariffs imposed by the Office of the US Trade Representative (USTR) on imports from China, which Tesla in its filing called ""arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion.""

The duties came amid a wider trade dispute between Washington and Beijing, and the automakers are asking for the tariffs to be revoked and any money paid to import parts returned.

Mercedes-Benz in its filing accused Washington of ""prosecution of an unprecedented, unbounded, and unlimited trade war impacting over $500 billion in imports from the People's Republic of China.""

The German automaker argued that US law ""did not confer authority on defendants to litigate a vast trade war for however long, and by whatever means, they choose.""

Officials at the office of US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer did not respond when contacted by AFP for comments on the lawsuits.

US President Donald Trump's administration engaged in months of trade conflicts with China, and imposed the levies as part of an effort to wean US manufacturers off Chinese technology.

China and the United States signed their ""phase one"" trade deal earlier this year that partially ended the dispute.

Under that agreement, Beijing promised to buy $200 billion in US goods and Washington backed down on tariffs on $160 billion in Chinese goods, particularly consumer electronics.

The US also slashed by half 15 per cent tariffs on $120 billion in goods, but kept in place 25 per cent duties on $250 billion in imports, which some of the automakers cited in their lawsuits.

Beijing has retaliated for these levies, while Washington is aiming both to reduce its trade deficit and reform Chinese business practices it considers unfair.

The commerce department reported the US trade deficit in July surged nearly 11 per cent to $63.6 billion, with the deficit with China climbing to $28.3 billion.

China is the world's biggest auto market and the main growth driver for many car manufacturers -- especially for electric car maker Tesla, which intends to benefit from the country's ambitious targets for reducing CO2 emissions.

NEW DELHI: A bottled-water and vaccine tycoon has become China’s wealthiest person in a day also marked by massive losses among the world’s tech elite.Zhong Shanshan’s net worth reached $58.7 billion on Wednesday, $2 billion more than Jack Ma ’s, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Zhong is now Asia’s second-richest person, behind India’s Mukesh Ambani, and is the 17th wealthiest in the world, ahead of Charles Koch and Phil Knight.Nicknamed “Lone Wolf” for his eschewing of politics and clubby business groups, Zhong’s fortune has jumped $51.9 billion in 2020, more than anyone else in the world except Amazon.com Inc’s Jeff Bezos and Tesla Inc’s Elon Musk. Both suffered heavy declines on Wednesday as tech stocks stumbled and Tesla plunged after its “Battery Day” event fell short of expectations. Musk’s fortune dropped by almost $10 billion.The initial public offering of bottled-water company Nongfu Spring Co -- which turned out to be Hong Kong’s most popular among retail investors -- propelled Zhong to China’s top three richest earlier this month. That came after the April listing of vaccine maker Beijing Wantai Biological Pharmacy Enterprise Co pushed his net worth to $20 billion by early August.Zhong now leads a wealth ranking in China that is typically dominated by people who made their fortunes from tech companies.While Zhong has surpassed Ma as China’s wealthiest, the tech tycoon might soon regain the top spot, which he’s held for most of the past six years after Alibaba went public in the US. Ant Group’s IPO next month is poised to boost his fortune, with his stake estimated at $28 billion if the company achieves the $250 billion valuation people familiar with the matter have said it’s targeting.Wednesday was brutal for US tech stocks, which tumbled the most since earlier this month. The plunge in Musk’s wealth was the biggest among the people on the Bloomberg ranking of the world’s 500 richest, followed by Bezos, whose net worth dropped by $7.1 billion. Musk is now worth $93.2 billion and Bezos $178 billion. Zhong added almost $4 billion Wednesday, more than anyone else in the index.","China has a new richest person, with Jack Ma dethroned"

WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump is infusing deliberations over his coming nomination of a new Supreme Court justice with political meaning as he aims to maximise the benefit before November 3 and even secure an electoral backstop should the result be contested.

Even before justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's death last week, the President had tried to use likelihood of more Supreme Court vacancies to his political advantage. Now, as he closes in on a decision on her likely replacement, Trump has used the vacancy to appeal to battleground-state voters and as a rallying cry for his conservative base.

He also is increasingly embracing the high court — which he will have had an outsized hand in reshaping – as an insurance policy in a close election.

Increases in mail, absentee and early voting brought about by the pandemic have already brought about a flurry of election litigation, and both Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden have assembled armies of lawyers to continue the fight once vote-counting begins. Trump has been open about tying his push to name a third justice to the court to a potentially drawn-out court fight to determine who will be sworn in on January 20, 2021.

""I think this will end up in the Supreme Court,"" Trump said on Wednesday of the election, adding, ""And I think it's very important that we have nine justices."" It's a line echoed by Trump allies, including Texas senator Ted Cruz, who said on Thursday, ""I think that threat to challenge the election is one of the real reasons why it is so important that we confirm the Supreme Court nominees, so that there's a full Supreme Court on the bench to resolve any election challenge.""

Barely six weeks from Election Day, and as millions of Americans are already voting, Trump and his advisers have tried to use the court vacancy to help deliver Trump another term in office.

Supreme Court nominations are never entirely devoid of political considerations, but Trump's decision has been particularly wrapped up in a charged political moment.

Within hours of Ginsburg's death, Trump made clear his intention to nominate a woman in her stead, after previously putting two men on the court and as he struggles to mitigate an erosion in support among suburban women.

In discussing his five-person short list, he's been sure to highlight some from election battlegrounds that he's aiming to win this fall as much as their jurisprudence.

""I've heard incredible things about her,"" he said of Florida's Barbara Lagoa, a day after Ginsburg's death. ""I don't know her. She's Hispanic and highly respected. Miami. Highly respected."" In an interview with a Detroit television station, he volunteered that hometown justice Joan Larsen is ""very talented.""

Trump was even considering a meeting with Lagoa this week in Florida, where he plans campaign events. The appellate court judge was confirmed last year by the Senate in a bipartisan vote and has been promoted for the court by GOP governor Ron DeSantis and others as a nominee with more across-the-board appeal.

Trump and his aides, though, appear to have set their sights on nominating judge Amy Coney Barrett of Indiana, who was at the White House twice this week, including for a Monday meeting with Trump.

The staunch conservative's 2017 confirmation on a party-line vote included allegations that Democrats were attacking her Catholic faith. Trump allies see that as a political windfall for them should Democrats attempt to do so once again. Catholic voters in Pennsylvania, in particular, are viewed as a pivotal demographic in the swing state that Democratic nominee Joe Biden is trying to recapture.

On Wednesday, Vice President Mike Pence defended Barrett when asked whether her affiliation with People of Praise, a charismatic Christian community, would complicate her ability to serve on the high court.

""I must tell you the intolerance expressed during her last confirmation about her Catholic faith I really think was a disservice to the process and a disappointment to millions of Americans,"" he told ABC News.

Trump played up the power to make judicial nominations with conservative voters in 2016, when Republicans senators kept open the seat vacated by the death of justice Antonin Scalia rather than let President Barack Obama fill the opening. Trump's decision to release lists of accomplished conservative jurists for potential elevation to the high court was rewarded by increased enthusiasm among white evangelical voters, many of whom had been resistant to supporting the candidacy of the one-time New York Democrat.

Even before Ginsburg's death, Trump had done the same in 2020, releasing an additional 20 names he would consider for the court, and encouraging Democrat Joe Biden to do the same.

Biden has resisted that pressure so far, but that hasn't stopped Trump from trying to sow fear among conservatives about whom the Democrat might nominate. ""So they don't want to show the judges because the only ones that he can put in are far-left radicals,"" Trump said this week.

""If Joe Biden and the Democrats take power, they will pack the Supreme Court with far-left radicals who will unilaterally transform American society far beyond recognition,"" Trump said at a rally outside Toledo on Monday. ""They will mutilate the law, disfigure the Constitution and impose a socialist vision from the bench that could never pass at the ballot box.""

"WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump was greeted with jeers and boos by a nearby crowd on Thursday as he visited the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 's flag-draped coffin outside the US Supreme Court.

Trump, wearing a black face mask and accompanied by first lady Melania Trump, stood near the casket at the marble court building amid chants of ""Vote him out."" The moment highlighted the public flashpoint that Ginsburg's death has become ahead of the Nov. 3 presidential election.

The Republican president , who has already installed two top court picks since taking office in 2017, has said he would unveil his latest choice on Saturday, a week after the 87-year-old justice died on Sept. 18.

His decision to move quickly on a replacement just six weeks before the election has drawn sharp battle lines between Republicans and Democrats , and reshaped the race for the White House as Trump seeks re-election during a coronavirus pandemic that has killed more than 200,000 people in the United States and devastated the economy.

Ginsburg, appointed by Democratic President Bill Clinton in 1993, was an icon for liberals, especially as the court grew increasingly conservative. Her death has sparked a renewed push by Democrats to get people to the polls in November and an outpouring of campaign donations.

Trump dismissed the protests.

""I think that was just a political chant. We could hardly hear it from where we were,"" he told reporters later in the day.

White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany called the chants ""appalling and disrespectful.""

Trump's election opponent, Democrat Joe Biden, will pay his respects to Ginsburg on Friday at the US Capitol.

After two days of public viewing at the court, Ginsburg will become on Friday the first woman to lie in state in the US Capitol when her casket is placed in National Statuary Hall .

Before Trump's election as president in 2016, Ginsburg criticized him publicly, calling him ""a faker"" in one interview. Trump responded by writing that Ginsburg's ""mind is shot"" on Twitter. She later apologized https://de.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-ginsburg-idUSKCN0ZU1PE, saying she regretted the ""ill-advised"" comments.

The president has maintained a respectful demeanor in his remarks about Ginsburg since her death, but he has drawn criticism from Democrats for not honoring her wish, reported to have been dictated in a statement to her granddaughter, that she be replaced by the next president.

WASHINGTON: A US judge said Thursday the Trump administration must either delay a ban on US app stores offering TikTok for download or file legal papers defending the decision by Friday.

The US Commerce Department order banning Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google app stores from offering the short video sharing app for new downloads is set to take effect late Sunday. US District Judge Carl Nichols said the government must file a response to a request by TikTok for a preliminary injunction or delay the order by 2:30 p.m. EDT Friday.

A federal judge in San Francisco on Saturday issued a preliminary injunction blocking a similar Commerce Department order from taking effect on Sunday on Tencent Holdings' WeChat app.

The Commerce Department said it plans to challenge the WeChat injunction, but government lawyers have not yet filed a appeal.

US officials have expressed serious concerns that the personal data of as many as 100 million Americans that use TikTok was being passed on to China's Communist Party government.

On Saturday, the Commerce Department announced a one-week delay in the TikTok order, citing ""recent positive developments"" in talks over the fate of its US operations.

TikTok said the restrictions ""were not motivated by a genuine national security concern, but rather by political considerations relating to the upcoming general election.""

TikTok's Chinese owner, ByteDance, said on Monday it will own 80% of TikTok Global, a newly created US company that will own most of the app's operations worldwide. ByteDance added that TikTok Global will become its subsidiary.

Oracle Corp and Walmart Inc have agreed to take stakes in TikTok Global of 12.5% and 7.5%, respectively. On Monday, Oracle said ByteDance's ownership of TikTok would be distributed to ByteDance's investors, and that the Beijing-based firm would have no stake in TikTok Global.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s former PM and PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif on Thursday banned his party members from holding any private meetings with the country’s military leadership . The move came a day after the Pakistan’s main opposition party found itself in an embarrassing position following army spokesperson Maj Gen Babar Iftikhar’s confirmation that senior PML-N leader Mohammad Zubair had held two meetings with army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa to discuss the future of Sharif and his daughter Maryam Nawaz .

Interestingly, a conference of all mainstream opposition parties on Sunday had accused the military establishment of interfering in Pakistan’s politics and elections.

If necessitated by national security or constitutional requirements, such meetings in the future will be approved by the party’s leadership and will be made public, Sharif wrote on Twitter. “I am instructing my party that no member in private, individual or collective capacity will meet any representative of army or intelligence agencies,” he said.

","No meetings with Pak military, Sharif warns party members"
"ISLAMABAD: As Pakistan’s civil-military leadership has agreed to make Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) the ‘fifth province’ of the country, local leaders there stand divided with some demanding more autonomy while others pitching for the Himalayan region – which is a part of Pak-occupied Kashmir -- to be merged as a full-fledged province of Pakistan.

Recently, the news of a secret meeting of Pakistan’s opposition leaders with army and ISI chiefs on September 16 had surfaced in which the opposition parties had agreed in principle to support the move to make GB the ‘fifth province’ of the country. During the meeting, it was also agreed, on opposition’s insistence, to take up the issue for discussion and legislation after the election for GB’s ‘legislative assembly’, which Pakistan has scheduled on November 15.

Since GB is a disputed region, some political observers believe that Islamabad needs to seek consent of the local population before any decision on their future. “They should be given a choice on what they stand for. Pakistani politicians should not impose a decision on future of GB’s residents without their consent,” said analyst Nazrul Islam. “The upcoming November election is significant in this regard. It remains to be seen whether the political parties will contest election on slogans of merging the land as the fifth province of Pakistan or other issues. More important would be the reaction of people - how they respond to any such call,” Islam added.

Some local politicians from GB who are against the idea of merger argue that it will severely damage Pakistan’s Kashmir cause.

Nawaz Khan Naji, who remained a member of GB’s ‘legislative assembly’ for nine years, was one of the strongest opponents of GB’s merger with Pakistan. “For seven decades, Pakistan had considered it as a disputed territory. It is not only in Pakistan’s interest but GB’s as well to give the region more autonomy instead of making it a province,” Naji said.

He said that Pakistan was doing it on China’s behest. “The China factor has complicated the situation for Pakistan. The Sino-US animosity has made the GB issue more controversial and the scope of Islamabad’s problems in the region has been widened as it has to now sustain pressure from Beijing ’s rivals too,” Naji added.

The local population is also concerned about their status after the merger. Currently, the GB region enjoys the status of a ‘tax-free zone’ and the ‘local government’ has no power to introduce taxes in the region, while the federal government subsidises wheat and petroleum products for locals. A number of GB residents that TOI spoke to opposed the idea of making their region a province of Pakistan, saying that it will end their exemption from taxes.

However, Muhammad Ali Khan, another politician from the region, is a staunch proponent of the idea of merger of GB with Pakistan. “From day one, we merged with Pakistan and now the government should declare this region a fifth province of the country,” said Khan, who has served as ‘cabinet minister’ in the region.

"Sri Lanka PM Mahinda Rajapaksa with Indian PM Narendra Modi (File photo)

COLOMBO: Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa and his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi will hold a virtual summit on September 26 during which the two leaders would discuss the entire gamut of bilateral relations, including defence and security issues, the foreign ministry here has announced.

The summit is being held on the initiative of Prime Minister Modi who had a telephonic conversation with the newly-appointed Sri Lankan Prime Minister Rajapaksa on August 6 this year, the ministry said in a statement.

""Looking forward to interacting with PM @narendramodi at the virtual summit scheduled for 26th September. We expect to review the multifaceted bilateral relationship between our nations, ranging from politics, economics, defense, tourism, and other areas of mutual interest,"" Rajapaksa said in a tweet on Wednesday.

The interaction is expected to focus on the full gamut of bilateral engagement inter-alia political, economic, finance, development, defence and security spheres, educational, tourism and cultural as well as regional and international issues of mutual interest,"" the Sri Lankan foreign ministry said in a statement on Wednesday.

Relevant subject ministers and senior officials of both countries will associate the leaders at the summit, it said.

This is the first virtual summit-level interaction by Prime Minister Rajapaksa with a foreign leader since assuming premiership last month, it added.

Responding to Rajapaksa's remarks, Modi tweeted on Thursday: ""Thank you, @PresRajapaksa! I too look forward to jointly reviewing our bilateral relationship comprehensively. We must explore ways to further enhance our cooperation in the post-COVID era.""

The two leaders are expected to deliberate on a host of issues like ways to further deepen anti-terror cooperation, boost overall defence and trade ties as well as implementation of India's development projects in Sri Lanka.

The long-pending Tamil issue in Sri Lanka is also likely to figure in the talks. India has been pitching for fulfilling the aspirations of the minority Tamil community in the island nation.

""The virtual bilateral summit will give an opportunity to the two leaders to comprehensively review the broad framework of the bilateral relationship soon after the Parliamentary elections in Sri Lanka and in the context of the time-tested friendly ties between the two countries,"" the Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement in New Delhi.

Prime Minister Modi visited Sri Lanka twice during the former regime of Maithripala Sirisena from 2015.

Both Mahinda Rajapaksa and his brother and President Gotabaya Rajapaksa chose India for their first overseas visit after winning the presidential election in November last year.

Sri Lanka waits in anticipation of India's action for a debt moratorium and an additional currency swap from India, said the foreign ministry officials in Colombo.

"KABUL: A group of young Afghans - both women and men - is coming together in the country's war-torn capital to practice a mystical Sufi Islamic dance.

The group's founder says she sees their whirling dance, known as Sema, as a way of carving out a space in the country's deeply conservative society , particularly when it comes to expectations about gender discrimination and dancing in mixed groups.

""I just wanted to express myself and my feelings with Sema dance,"" said Fahima Mirzaie, a 24-year-old economist.

She recently danced alongside male members of her troupe at a cultural event hosted in a somewhat incongruous setting - an Italian restaurant in central Kabul. That night, she was the only women from her group dancing, although other women watched and read poetry.

As she spins, one hand reaches toward heaven and the other toward the earth, her white robe flowing, in the familiar image of a so-called ""whirling dervish"" seen across the Middle East and Central Asia. Dancers spin repetitively in prayer, chanting Allah and gaining in speed, seeking to lose themselves in a spiritual trance that they believe unites them with God.

But Afghanistan is not widely accepting of this mystical interpretation, and Sufism as well as dancing and singing were both rejected by the Taliban. Many Afghan women are wary of the Taliban returning to power in some form as part of a future peace deal, recalling the years of oppression under a strict form of Islamic law. But even in today's Afghanistan, women and men dancing together in public is mostly rejected as being against the country's culture, traditions and religious beliefs.

Most of the members of Mirzaie's dance group, which features men and women performing in public, are Shiite Muslims. They're a minority in Afghanistan that's been targeted for attacks by the Islamic State group, which considers Shiites - Sufi or otherwise - to be heretics. There are other Sufi dance groups scattered across the country's provinces too, primarily men but some women, who perform in front of mixed audiences.

Mirzaie says she's unfazed by what people may say about her dancing. As part of the generation that's grown up during Afghanistan's latest war, she's concerned about the violence in her society. She hopes she can change it through Sufism and the poems of Rumi, who's possibly the most well-known Sufi mystic.

Afghanistan has been at war for more than four decades, first against the invading Soviet army, then warring mujaheddin groups in a bitter civil war, followed by the repressive Taliban rule and finally the latest war that began after the 2001 U.S.-led coalition invasion that toppled the Taliban government.

Her group has also used Sufi dance to help them get through the coronavirus pandemic . During a lockdown earlier this year, Mirzaie closed her center and provided training to her students online.

Now, she's back whirling in person. At the Italian restaurant, Abdul Ahad , a civil society activist, said he'd been to a few Sufi events in Afghanistan that perform in private, but this was the first time he's seen women doing it.

Mirzaie's mother Qamar says she's worried for her daughter. ""There's no security and girls are taunted on their way out to work.""

She says she stays awake at night, waiting until Mirzaie returns home after dancing.

Mirzaie's father, an ex-colonel in the traffic police, her sister and her mother are among her few supporters.

But despite these concerns, she says she cannot live by someone else's rules.

""I never asked anyone's permission for starting it and I will not need anyone's permission to end it, so I will never stop or surrender to anyone.""

"LONDON: Britain 's Prince Harry and his American wife Meghan have called on Americans to register to vote in the upcoming US presidential election, entering into political territory where British royals traditionally do not venture.

In a video for 2020 Time 100, the US magazine's list of the world's most influential people, the couple said people who were able to cast their vote, should do so.

Harry and Meghan now live in California, having stepped down from their senior royal roles in March.

""Every four years we are told the same thing that this is the most important election of our lifetime,"" Meghan said.

""But this one is. When we vote, our values are put into action and our voices are heard, your voice is a reminder that you matter, because you do, and you deserve to be heard.""

Meghan, who married Queen Elizabeth 's grandson in 2018, criticized U.S. President Donald Trump during his 2016 election campaign as being misogynistic and divisive.

Last year, Trump, on being told of Meghan's criticism, said: ""I didn't know that. What can I say? I didn't know that she was nasty.""

Under Britain's unwritten constitution, the royal family are expected to remain politically neutral and do not vote in elections. The queen, 94, has rarely strayed into current affairs issues during her 68-year reign.

""This election, I'm not going to be able to vote in the U.S., but many of you may not know that I haven't been able to vote in the UK my entire life,"" Harry said in the video. ""As we approach this November, it's vital that we reject hate speech, misinformation and online negativity.""

While Harry did not endorse Trump's opponent, Democrat challenger Joe Biden , his comments led to criticism he was interfering in politics.

""Prince Harry poking his woke nose into the U.S. election & effectively telling Americans to vote against President Trump is completely unacceptable behaviour for a member of the Royal Family,"" Piers Morgan , a former CNN television host and now a British breakfast show presenter, wrote on Twitter.

"STOCKHOLM: The European Union raised the alarm on Thursday over the coronavirus pandemic , saying it is worse now than at the March peak in several member countries, as governments in Europe and beyond reimpose drastic measures.Israel, which closed schools and imposed restrictions on workplaces and leisure activities last week in a second nationwide lockdown, toughened its rules still further on Thursday.Most workplaces and markets are to be closed and prayer meetings and demonstrations will be severely restricted, as the country battles the world's worst per-capita infection rate.The strict measures imposed during the earlier phase of the epidemic, which has now infected more than 30 million and killed more than 950,000, crippled businesses and helped to plunge the world into recession.On Thursday, the IMF said the economic outlook was brighter now than it had been in June, a spokesman suggesting that some parts of the global economy were ""beginning to turn the corner"".Though he added that the outlook remained ""very challenging"".The economy in the United States, which is battling the world's worst outbreak, also had some rare good news with a 4.8 per cent rise in home sales in August.EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides said in ""some member states, the situation is now even worse than during the peak in March"".The death rate has not returned to the levels seen earlier this year but new infections are soaring once again, prompting the bloc's disease control agency to flag seven countries of ""high concern"".The countries, including Spain and several of the EU's eastern states, have ""an increased proportion of hospitalised and severe cases"" among older people and rising death notification rates.Although France was not among those nations, it has tightened its measures -- closing restaurants, workplaces and gyms as businesses already hammered by the earlier lockdown struggle to stay afloat.Bars in Paris and 10 other cities will be forced to close early and the southern city of Marseille will see restaurants and bars close completely.Local officials have reacted with anger and frustration.Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo said on Thursday she had lodged a formal protest, particularly the closure of gyms.""How will the fact that we can no longer exercise help us, while sport is an important part of keeping us healthy with strong immune systems,"" she asked.Health experts also warned that governments risked losing the trust of the population.Hagai Levine, an epidemiologist who is part of Israel's anti-coronavirus taskforce, said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 's rush to ease the first lockdown caused the current crisis.""When there is no plan, no logic, the public loses its trust,"" he said.For some, that lack of trust also extends to the rush to get out a vaccine, with nine candidates worldwide currently in final clinical trials.In Russia, a vaccine has already been approved even though full clinical trials have yet to be completed, raising concerns about its safety.On Thursday, Russian cosmonauts set to blast off for the International Space Station (ISS) said it was too early to get the vaccine touted by President Vladimir Putin.""I'd personally say that I would not get vaccinated because I tread very carefully on this issue,"" said Sergei Ryzhikov, the leader of the next expedition to the ISS in October.The rollout of a vaccine is seen as crucial in many walks of life, particularly sport, where those events that are taking place are generally behind closed doors.However, Olympic boss Thomas Bach said the postponed Tokyo Games could take place next year even without a vaccine.""A number of big sport events have been successfully organised recently,"" he said, pointing for instance to the success of the Tour de France Elsewhere in the world of sport, Swedish striker and AC Milan star Zlatan Ibrahimovic, 38, has tested positive for coronavirus, his club announced on Thursday.","EU warns virus epidemic worsening, as restrictions ramp up"
"BRUSSELS: President Alexander Lukashenko is not the legitimate president of Belarus , the European Union said on Thursday, saying his abrupt swearing-in on Wednesday went directly against the will of the people.

The ceremony accelerated EU plans to boycott Lukashenko following the disputed August 9 election, as the European Parliament had earlier decided not to recognise the veteran leader from November, when his term as president was due to end.

""The so-called 'inauguration' ... and the new mandate claimed by Aleksander Lukashenko lack(s) any democratic legitimacy,"" the EU's 27 states said in a statement.

""This 'inauguration' directly contradicts the will of large parts of the Belarusian population, as expressed in numerous, unprecedented and peaceful protests since the elections, and serves to only further deepen the political crisis in Belarus.""

The EU, a large financial donor to Belarus, also said it was ""reviewing its relations"" with the country, meaning the bloc would seek to cut off direct funding to Lukashenko's government, channelling it to aid groups and hospitals instead.

Before the election, the EU had committed to spend 135 million euros on projects in Belarus and has also pledged 53 million euros for the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic .

Opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya discussed with EU foreign ministers on Monday in Brussels how to bypass state administration to support doctors and hospitals.

"STOCKHOLM: Winners of the prestigious Nobel prizes this year will receive an extra 1 million crowns ($110,000), the head of the foundation which oversees the awards said on Thursday.

Prize money will increase to 10 million crowns this year, daily Dagens Industri reported.

""The decision has been made due to the fact that our costs and capital are in a stable relation in a completely different way than previously,"" the head of the Nobel Foundation , Lars Heikensten, told the paper.

Dynamite inventor Alfred Nobel left around 31 million crowns - about 1.8 billion crowns in today's money according to the Foundation - to fund the prizes, which have been awarded since 1901.

The prize amount has varied over time, starting at 150,000 crowns and reaching 1 million crowns in 1981.

The value rose sharply in the 1980s and 1990s, jumping to 9 million crowns in 2000 and 10 million a year later.

But the global credit crunch of 2008-9 hit the Foundation's investments and Heikensten, a former central bank chief, was brought in to get its finances in order.

The prize money was cut to 8 million crowns in 2012 only to rise again to 9 million in 2017.

Heikensten, who steps down at the end of this year to be replaced by former Norwegian foreign minister Vidar Helgesen , said the Foundation would continue to raise the amount of the prize money ""from time to time"".

"China's aircraft carrier Liaoning sails past a container ship as it enters Hong Kong (Reuters)

BEIJING: China's two aircraft carriers Liaoning and Shandong have completed routine training and sea trials, a spokesperson for the Ministry of National Defence said on Thursday.

The training was aimed at testing the performance of the aircraft carriers' weapons and equipment, improving the training level of such warships and honing the capabilities of personnel to fulfill missions.

Senior Colonel Tan Kefei, spokesperson for China's Ministry of National Defence, made the remarks during an online press briefing when asked about US media reports that the two Chinese aircraft carriers have performed maritime training missions at the same time to improve the capability of ""Dual Carrier Operations"".

Liaoning, a refit of the Soviet-era ship which was commissioned in 2012, is already operational.

The second indigenously developed carrier, Shandong is undergoing sea trials while the third one is under construction.

Official media reports say China plans to have six aircraft carriers.

Shandong with a displacement of around 40,000-60,000 tonnes is bigger than Liaoning and could house 36 fighter jets compared to 24 by Liaoning besides helicopters, Chinese media reports earlier said.

TAIPEI: Taiwan on Thursday condemned recent Chinese military activity after Beijing sent two military surveillance planes toward the island for three straight days, calling it a “deliberate provocation.”

Tensions have risen in the Taiwan Strait as the US has stepped up its official engagement with the self-ruled island that China considers part of its national territory.

On Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, China sent two planes into Taiwan's air defence identification zone, according to Taiwan's Ministry of National defence. In response, the Taiwanese side dispatched air patrols, the ministry said.

“We oppose China using military force against Taiwan, deliberately violating Taiwan's naval and airspace safety and damaging the status quo,” added Chiu Chui-Cheng, deputy minister at Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council .

“Our government will continue to cooperate with countries with similar values.” Last week, China sent a total of 37 warplanes, including bombers and fighter jets, across the Taiwan Strait in a warning as a high-level US State Department official visited the island.

The Taiwanese defence ministry said the planes crossed the midline of the Taiwan Strait.

The midline has acted as an unofficial buffer zone between China and Taiwan for decades, in what Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council on Thursday called “a tacit agreement that has kept the peace.”

Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin on Monday denied the existence of any midline, saying that Taiwan is part of China. He also warned that China would retaliate for the US visit. “We will take countermeasures, including against relevant individuals,"" he said.

Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen has remained defiant, visiting a military base on Tuesday and encouraging the personnel, in particular pilots and crew.

Taiwanese foreign minister Joseph Wu said in July that Chinese military exercises have increased in frequency and become “virtually a daily occurrence.""

China has increased diplomatic and military pressure on Tsai's government over her refusal to agree to China's insistence that the island be considered part of Chinese territory.

The vast majority of Taiwanese reject the prospect of political union with China under the “one country, two systems” framework used for Hong Kong .

Following Tsai's election in 2016, China cut off contact with the Taiwanese government and has sought to isolate it, siphoning off the island's diplomatic allies while ratcheting up political, military and economic pressure.

DUBAI: The United Arab Emirates will resume issuing visas to foreign visitors to all seven of its regions as of Thursday after a six-month suspension imposed due to the coronavirus pandemic, state media reported.

Dubai, the region's tourism and business hub and one of the seven emirates that make up the UAE, had already lifted its own visa ban in July.

The Federal Authority for Identity and Citizenship said in a statement carried in state media that the decision was taken as part of the easing of Covid-19 restrictions in the Gulf state as well as efforts to support economic recovery plans.

All six Gulf Arab countries have lifted internal curfews and lockdowns, but restrictions on gatherings and foreign travel remain in the oil-producing region, where the total number of Covid cases stands at over 800,000, with more than 6,800 deaths.

Neighbouring Oman said on Thursday it would resume scheduled international flights on Oct. 1 with strict measures to protect the country and aviation staff from the virus.

Prayers and political demonstrations would be limited to open spaces and no more than 20 people, and participants would not be able to travel more than a kilometer (0.6 miles) from home for either.The measures are set to go into force on Friday afternoon, as the country shuts down for the weekly Sabbath ahead of Yom Kippur on Sunday and Monday. Israel annually closes down for 24 hours in honor of the solemn holiday.The restrictions are to last for at least two weeks, but synagogues will be allowed to open under restrictive conditions for Yom Kippur prayers.The restrictions on demonstrations are subject to approval by the Knesset, Israel's parliament, and the limits on both prayers and protests could spark a backlash. An anti-lockdown demonstration was planned for later in the day in front of the Knesset.Israel's politically influential ultra-Orthodox community has objected to limits on public prayer during the ongoing Jewish High Holidays, and opponents of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have accused the government of using the lockdown as a cover to end weekly demonstrations against his handling of the crisis.Israel is currently reporting nearly 7,000 new daily cases, making the outbreak in the country of 9 million people among the worst in the world on a per capita basis.

But then it reopened the economy too quickly, leading to a surge of new infections over the summer.Many businesses, meanwhile, have yet to recover from the earlier lockdown, and the new restrictions are expected to take a heavy toll on the economy even though they are being imposed during the holidays, when many businesses would ordinarily scale back hours.Israel has reported a total of more than 200,000 cases since the pandemic began, including 1,335 deaths.

In the space of one month, the country recorded one thousand deaths.That initial toll was worse than the total number of deaths caused by earlier acute respiratory syndrome SARS, which circulated in Asia in 2002-2003 and led to 774 fatalities.Countries and territories outside continental China were relatively untouched at that point but the virus was already starting to circulate there.The Philippines registered its first case on February 2 and Hong Kong two days later, followed by Japan and France on February 13 and 14.In February cases soared. By March 11, when the WHO declared the new coronavirus a ""pandemic"", 4,500 deaths had been recorded worldwide, across 30 countries and territories.Two-thirds were still in China but Italy (800 deaths) and Iran (300 deaths) saw cases escalate, with deaths soon following.The number of people dying every day in Europe and the United States rose swiftly up until mid-April, reaching peaks in the second week of more than 4,000 and 2,700 average daily deaths respectively.Today the United States remains the hardest-hit country for deaths, with over 200,000 recorded.On a global scale, the deadliest week was April 13 to 19 when more than 7,460 coronavirus deaths were officially reported every day. By then the total number of deaths worldwide had risen to nearly 170,000, or double the level reported on March 31.Since the start of June, the average number of deaths per day has hovered around 5,000.In June, the epicentre of the pandemic shifted to Latin America and the Caribbean.

The continent has exceeded 1,000 deaths per day almost continually since July 20 and is today approaching 1,500 (1,407 on average over the last seven days).India has been the worst hit, recording a total of 90,000 deaths (more than 1,100 per day last week).Cases are also rising again in Europe, reinforcing concerns about a possible second wave. New cases on the continent are around 20 percent higher this week than last and deaths are up 28 percent at 614.Fatalities are also increasing again in the Middle East (around 330 last week, up 18 percent on the week before).According to official statistics, Africa has been less affected than other continents: deaths have been falling since August (fewer than 200 per day in mid-September, after a peak of around 400 in early August).In Oceania, meanwhile, the average daily number of deaths has never exceeded two dozen.",How coronavirus has spread across the world

's League of Samba Schools, LIESA, announced that the spread of the

has made it impossible to safely hold the traditional parades that are a cultural mainstay and, for many, a source of livelihood.

""Carnival is a party upon which many humble workers depend. The samba schools are community institutions, and the parades are just one detail of all that,'' said Luiz Antonio Simas, a historian who specializes in

Rio

's Carnival. ""An entire cultural and productive chain was disrupted by COVID.''

Rio

's City Hall has yet to announce a decision about the Carnival street parties that also take place across the city. But its tourism promotion agency said in a statement to The Associated Press on Sept. 17 that without a coronavirus

, it is uncertain when large public events can resume.

Brazil's first confirmed coronavirus case was Feb. 26, one day after this year's Carnival ended. As the number of infections grew, the samba schools that participate in the glitzy annual parade halted preparations for the 2021 event. Thursday's announcement removed the cloud of uncertainty that has hung over the city -- one of worst hit by the pandemic in Brazil.

Nearly all of

Rio

's samba schools are closely linked to working class communities. Their processions include elaborate floats accompanied by tireless drummers and costumed dancers who sing at the top of their lungs to impress a panel of judges. Tens of thousands of spectators pack the bleachers of the arena, known as the Sambadrome, while tens of millions watch on television.

Before the schools began competing in the 1930s, Carnival was celebrated in dance halls and haphazardly on the streets, Simas said. The parades entered the Sambadrome in the 1980s, and have become

Rio

's quintessential Carnival display.

The immense labor required for each show was already stymied by restrictions on gatherings that

Rio

Beneath the Sambadrome's bleachers, the city created a homeless shelter for the vulnerable population during the pandemic.

Samba schools suspended float construction, costume sewing, dance rehearsals, and also social projects. The Mangueira school's program in the favela near downtown

Some performers resorted to odd jobs and gigs. Diogo Jesus, the lead dancer referred to as ""master of ceremonies'' in the Mocidade school, couldn't make rent without his income from private events. He started driving for Uber and sewing facemasks to sell at a fair.

""It was a blow. We live Carnival all year round, and many people when they realized everything would stop wound up getting sick or depressed,'' Jesus said in an interview inside his house in Madureira, a neighborhood in northern

""We must await the coming months for definition about if there will be a vaccine or not, and when there will be immunization,'' LIESA's Castanheira told reporters in

The mayor also voiced opposition to unregulated celebrations, but many

Some parties are small -- for example one including a few dozen dog owners exhibiting their pets wearing wigs or funny hats. But most feature amps blasting music to throngs of thousands who dance, kiss and swill booze in a crush of celebration. The biggest one boasts more than two million partygoers.

Rita Fernandes, president of Os Blocos da Sebastiana, said her association already canceled its 11 street parties that together draw 1.5 million revelers. Most others groups will follow, she said.

""We cannot be irresponsible and bring the multitudes to the street,'' she said, pointing to Europe's second wave of contagion.

A drummer in Mangueira's samba school, Laudo Braz Neto, said the children he instructed before the pandemic are listless, and he knows there is no way to put on Carnival without being able to safely gather.

LONDON: Holders Manchester City needed a Phil Foden goal 15 minutes from time to see off Bournemouth 2-1 and reach the fourth round of the League Cup , while Liverpool ran riot in a 7-2 win at Lincoln on Thursday.City have won the competition for the past three years, but Pep Guardiola admitted he had been forced to name a youthful side to prioritise their Premier League campaign due to a shortened pre-season and a series of positive coronavirus tests.Liam Delap, son of former Stoke midfielder Rory Delap, took just 18 minutes to score on his City debut with a fine finish into the top corner from Foden's pass.""He's a different striker to what we have in terms of physicality. We see in training how good a finisher he is,"" said Guardiola of the 17-year-old.However, the lead lasted just four minutes as Bournemouth's Sam Sturridge spun inside the City box before firing into the far corner.Guardiola introduced the artillery he had on the bench after half-time in Kevin de Bruyne and Raheem Sterling, but it was another first-team regular in Foden who made the breakthrough after Riyad Mahrez's shot came back off the post.City will travel to Burnley in the last 16.Liverpool will face Arsenal twice at Anfield in three days next week after Jurgen Klopp's much-changed side hit Lincoln for seven with Takumi Minamino and Curtis Jones both scoring twice.""Everybody used the opportunity tonight to show up, that's very important,"" said Klopp.""Who shows the desire we saw tonight, who shows the attitude we saw tonight, who shows so many things that I like and we want to see when a Liverpool team shows up, then there's a big chance you'll get a lot of games during the season.""Xherdan Shaqiri opened the floodgates with a brilliant free-kick that clipped the underside of the bar.Minamino curled home to double the Premier League champions' lead before Curtis Jones struck twice in four minutes to make it 4-0 before half-time.A minute into the second-half, Minamino had his second, but League One Lincoln responded to get two goals to remember the night by.Tayo Edun finished off a great team move and Lewis Montsma headed home a corner.But Liverpool continued to find the net at the other end as Marko Grujic briefly made it 6-1 before Divock Origi rounded off the scoring.Bertrand Traore marked his Aston Villa debut with a stunning side-foot volley to score his side's second goal in a comfortable 3-0 win at Bristol City.Anwar El Ghazi opened the scoring 11 minutes in before Traore showed why Villa spent £17 million ($21 million) to sign him from Lyon last week with a cute finish from a narrow angle.Another Villa new boy Ollie Watkins then grabbed his first goal for the club 17 minutes from time as Dean Smith's men set up a last 16 clash with Stoke.","Manchester City, Liverpool reach League Cup fourth round"

BUDAPEST: Bayern Munich beat Sevilla 2-1 after extra time on Thursday to lift the UEFA Super Cup and complete a quadruple under coach Hansi Flick, in the first European game played with fans in the stands since the sport returned amid the Covid-19 pandemic.Substitute Javi Martinez, in possibly his last game for Bayern, headed the winner in the 104th minute after Europa League winners Sevilla had taken a 13th-minute lead through Lucas Ocampos's penalty and Bayern levelled through Leon Goretzka in the 34th.The Bavarians, unbeaten now in 32 consecutive matches, also won the domestic league and Cup double as well as the Champions League after Flick took over last November. Their last defeat dates back to December, 2019.""It was an intense game but we deserved to win,"" Flick told reporters. ""We are not yet fully in our rhythm despite our big win (8-0) over Schalke 04 on the weekend.""But the mentality of the team, especially after going 1-0 down, was sensational. They battled back against very strong opponents and deserved the win.""Bayern were the better side throughout and missed a bagful of chances through Robert Lewandowski, Benjamin Pavard and Thomas Mueller in the first half,Yet it was Bayern keeper Neuer who kept them in the game first with a one-on-one save against Youssef En-Nesyri to send the game to extra time and then pushing another shot from the Sevilla player onto the post two minutes into extra time.The Spaniards gradually ran out of steam, however, and it was only a matter of time until Bayern scored again.Martinez, who is reportedly close to agreeing to a return to Athletic Bilbao this season, benefited from being given too much space to head in on the rebound.The Spaniard also scored in extra time in Bayern's only previous Super Cup win in 2013.Some 15,000 fans were seated in Budapest's Puskas Arena with the game seen as a test event for the gradual return of fans to European games.""We all know it is not easy to take right decision,"" Flick said of allowing fans. ""But it felt good to have an atmosphere in the stadium. It felt a bit more like football . I hope all the fans return home healthy.""The match was held amid a growing second wave of COVID-19, with Hungarian cases at record highs, which had prompted warnings of the possible consequences of mass gatherings such as this game.",Bayern Munich stay strong to complete quadruple with Super Cup win

Given the fact that the players are coming out of a break of about five to six months and that they have not necessarily been able to have an adequate pre-season, we thought it wise to have the five substitutions in place,"" said the All India Football Federation Leagues CEO Sunando Dhar There is also likely to be a water break in each half.The I-League qualifiers will commence on October 8 and the rules are also set to be applied in the I-League which is expected to start later in the year.",I-League qualifiers set to have 5-substitution rule

BENGALURU: A bylane off Swami Vivekananda road, near Trinity circle, leads to Murphy Town - one of the oldest suburbs of the Cantonment area. As you make your way through the narrow lanes, a concrete road leads to the Murphy Town ground, also known as the Dr Ambedkar playground.The ground is home to the Murphy Town Football Club and the Primrose Hockey Club , which was established here in 1959.In pre-Covid times, the ground used to be the centre of sports activities. The Primrose Hockey Club players occupied one part of the ground while footballers and cricketers shared space with track and field athletes. Not to forget the senior citizens on their morning or evening stroll.Now, what remains of the ground, once a nursery to many international hockey and football stalwarts like Ashish Ballal and Arumainayagam, is piles of debris and stagnant water.Demolition and groundwork has already begun and if the BBMP has its way, the ground may make way for a 9-a-side football stadium complete with a gallery and commercial establishments on the periphery.The move by the authorities has left the residents of Murphy Town and its neighbourhood heartbroken. While they are not against development, they don't want to be robbed of their playground and lung space. Among those impacted will also be hundreds of government schoolchildren, for whom it is the only playground. The compound wall itself is lined by three government schools which use the facility during their physical education periods and annual sports day.The ground is spread over 7,875 sq metres and the proposed project will see the playing area reduced to 3375 sq meters. The bhoomi puja for the proposed stadium was conducted on September 7.On Wednesday, some of the sporting veterans representing the residents (BBMP ward No. 80), met at the ground to sign a petition to be submitted to the BBMP.""We are not against development but it should be for the betterment of sports in this area. If the BBMP goes ahead with the project, the children of this area, who mostly belong to the lower socio-economic groups, will be deprived of their playing space. They can't afford to play in private facilities. This is their home and we don't want that to be snatched away from them,"" said a crestfallen Kadirvelu, a former athlete and a senior citizen from the locality.The locals fear that if the space is taken away from budding athletes, the absence of sports may lead them down the path of anti-social activities.""They don't just learn or play sports on the ground. For example, youngsters who come to our club are also trained in life skills. For them sport is a way of life which keeps them away from unwanted distractions,"" explained Vijay from Primrose Hockey Club.Seasoned hockey coach Edward Brient, who has mentored many state and national players, pointed out that there are no public grounds in the vicinity barring the Gowthamapura football ground which is overcrowded.""All we want the BBMP is to upgrade facilities like drainage and sanitation. We will be grateful if they can do that much,"" added Brient.In 1982, when there was a proposal to establish the Ulsoor bus depot at the playground, the locals managed to convince the authorities to overturn the decision and are hoping they can do the same this time as well.",Murphy Town ground may soon be history

We were all briefed on guidelines to follow once the National Camp would begin so in that sense, resuming activities was smooth. Now our top priority is to hit the same fitness levels we were at earlier this year.

SOCHI: Kimi Raikkonen typically avoided any fuss on Thursday over talk of his equalling Rubens Barrichello 's record this weekend as Formula One's most experienced driver.

The taciturn Finn, dubbed 'the ice man', will start his 322nd race in Sunday's Russian Grand Prix when Lewis Hamilton could equal Michael Schumacher's record of 91 wins.

""It's just another race,"" said the Alfa Romeo driver . ""I'll try to make it a good one and let's see what happens and comes out of it.

""I think every record will end up being broken at some point in most sports -- that's how it has always happened. As I've said many times, it doesn't mean anything for me.

""It doesn't make any difference. Maybe in the future, when I'll look back at things, whatever the number will be, maybe I'll look at it differently....""

Raikkonen, 41 next month, entered F1 in 2001 with Sauber and has raced for McLaren, Ferrari (in two spells) and Lotus, winning the drivers' world title in 2007 with Ferrari.

He began his career at the 2001 Australian Grand Prix after only 23 car races of any sort, following his karting days and missed both the 2010 and 2011 F1 seasons to go rallying.

SOCHI (Russia): Romain Grosjean has options for the future if he is ditched by Haas this year - and may switch to Formula E and the world endurance series in 2021.

The Frenchman, in his fifth season with the American team, hopes to stay in Formula One , but is prepared to switch, he told reporters on Thursday.

Speaking at a video news conference ahead of this weekend's Russian Grand Prix, Grosjean conceded that Haas has several drivers to choose from for next year.

""Obviously there aren't many seats left in F1 -- and there are many candidates,"" he said.

""So I do understand the point of view from Haas. It totally makes sense they're not in a rush, but I don't think I'm in a rush either.

""There are options elsewhere as well, which can be interesting, but obviously Formula One is Formula One.

""Coming from Mugello, after driving those cars in Mugello, you're like 'yeah, you know what, it's absolutely unique what I'm driving'.

""In America, obviously IndyCar is a beautiful championship, but I'm not really tempted by ovals - they even may scare me, so I don't really want to do ovals.

""In the future, Hypercar at the Le Mans 24 Hours and the World Endurance Championship can be nice. Formula E is definitely an option... There are some good drivers there and some good teams.

""And F1 obviously -- everyone can do the maths and see where the seats available are.""

His Haas team-mate Kevin Magnussen said he was also considering his future.

Mexican Sergio Perez will miss out on an aerodynamic upgrade package at this weekend's Russian Formula One Grand Prix after his Racing Point team were unable to provide enough parts for both cars.

Team mate Lance Stroll was the only one of the two to have the upgrade at the previous Tuscan Grand Prix in Italy but the Canadian suffered a big crash, wrecking the new parts.

Racing Point had hoped to provide both drivers with the new package in Sochi but were forced to shelve those plans after Stroll's accident left them in a race against time to build sufficient spares.

The team said Stroll, whose father Lawrence owns the team, will again have the upgrade as he is ahead of Perez in the championship.

Perez is leaving the team at the end of the season to make way for four-times world champion Sebastian Vettel , currently at Ferrari .

""I wish I had the upgrade for this race but for obvious reasons I won't have them,"" said Perez, who has scored points at every Russian Grand Prix so far.

""The team is working hard to try to give me the upgrades hopefully for the next weekend

NEW DELHI: The Sports Authority of India (SAI) on Saturday approved former world no. 1 Kidambi Srikanth 's request to allow his coach and physiotherapist to accompany him for the Denmark Open badminton tournament scheduled to be held in Odense from October 13 to 18.

The 27-year-old is part of the Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS) and thus will receive support by SAI. He has also sought permission to reach the tournament early.

""The proposal to participate in the competition came from Srikanth, who has also requested that he be allowed to reach the venue early and that his coach and physio be allowed to accompany him for the tournament,"" a SAI release stated.

""However, their names are still to be decided,"" it added.

SAI will also bear the cost for Srikanth's COVID-19 testing that is required to be done before he takes part in the competition.

The Denmark Open will mark the resumption of international badminton after it came to a halt in March because of the dreaded virus.

Besides Srikanth, former world no 1 Saina Nehwal and Lakshya Sen will be participating in the event. The trio were part of the six-member team selected for the event by Badminton Association of India.

Olympic silver medallist PV Sindhu, doubles pair of N Sikki Reddy and Ashwini Ponnappa , had pulled out of the event.

Earlier this week, the Badminton World Federation (BWF) was forced to postpone the Thomas and Uber Cup after multiple teams pulled out due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Srikanth would have spearheaded the Indian men's campaign in Thomas Cup, while Saina Nehwal, along with Olympic silver medallist P V Sindhu, were supposed to lead the 10-member women's team in the Uber Cup.

The world body also cancelled the Denmark Masters 2020 scheduled from October 20 to 25.

"Saina Nehwal and PV Sindhu

HYDERABAD: PV Sindhu has withdrawn from the Danisa Denmark Open while six others, including Saina Nehwal , have confirmed their participation by signing the consent form sent by Badminton Association of India (BAI).

Saina had questioned the timing of the Thomas and Uber Cup (TUC) — which has been postponed to next year — but seems to be fine with the Denmark Open, beginning on October 13, two days after TUC would have ended if the schedule was adhered to.

Ranking points could be the reason Saina decided to compete in this tournament. The Olympic qualification of Saina and Kidambi Srikanth hangs by a thread and both need thousands of ranking points to make it to Tokyo.

Saina and Srikanth apart, Parupalli Kashyap, Ajay Jayram, Subhankar Dey and Lakshya Sen also confirmed for the event.

Sindhu, Sikki Reddy, Ashwini Ponnappa and the men's doubles pair of Manu Attri and Sumeeth Reddy pulled out.

""I have pulled out of the Denmark Open,” Sindhu told TOI on Thursday. “Since TUC was a team event, I wanted to represent my country. Now that it’s postponed, there is no point going to Denmark. If I play that tournament, I have to be in home quarantine for 14 days on return to India. Moreover, I am planning to compete in the three Asian tournaments. That's why I pulled out of this event,"" Sindhu added.

Doubles specialist Sikki said, “Had there been at least two tournaments we could have gone. Going there for just one tournament is risky.""

Of the six, the government will sponsor the stay and travel of Saina, Srikanth and Lakshya. These three shuttlers were part of the six-member team that BAI had named, the other three being Sindhu, Sikki and Ashwini.

There was some disappointment regarding the consent form, but a BAI official said on condition of anonymity that SAI SOPs are being followed. “It is clear in SOPs that a player has to give his/her consent in these pandemic times. We are not shying away from responsibilities. Even for shuttlers not sponsored by the government, we will arrange for visa, accommodation on concessional rates and any other help,” the official said.

NEW DELHI: Many in India woke up to a pleasant surprise on Thursday as Google remembered legendary Indian swimmer Arati Saha by dedicating the day's doodle to her, on what would have been her 80th birthday.

Saha was the first Asian woman to swim across the English Channel on September 29, 1959. She covered a distance of 67.5 km from Cape Gris Nez, France to Sandgate, England in 16 hours and 20 minutes. Upon reaching the English side of the Channel, she hoisted the Indian flag. This was her second attempt at crossing the Channel.

Later, during several interviews over the years, Saha mentioned that she was inspired by another long distance swimmer, Mihir Sen , who was the first Indian to swim the English Channel (in 1958).

Following her spectacular feat, she was awarded the Padma Shri in 1960, becoming the first Indian sportswoman to be given the honour.

In 1999, the Indian postal department celebrated her accomplishment by unveiling a Rs 3 postage stamp in her name. Saha also represented India in the 1952 Helsinki Olympics at a tender age of 11.

Saha was born in a middle-class Bengali family in Kolkata, the second of three children. She started swimming at an early age of four on the banks of Hooghly river and won her first gold medal in swimming as a 5-year-old. Her talent was spotted and honed by one of the country's best of the time, Sachin Nag .

Thursday's doodle is a depiction of Saha swimming along with a compass and a view of the ocean, in reference to her journey across the English Channel. It was illustrated by fellow Kolkata native, artist Lavanya Naidu .

Saha passed away in 1994 after battling acute jaundice and encephalitis.

CHENNAI: National rower Rohith Maradapa last trained in the waters over six months ago --- before the nationwide lockdown came into place. With most sporting disciplines opening up in the city in the last few weeks, rowing too will be joining the bandwagon.

By the end of this month, Rohith --- along with many other rowers will get an opportunity to resume their practice sessions at the Sri Ramachandra Water Sports Centre (SRWSC) in Porur.

The Madras Boat Club (MBC), the other rowing facility in the city, will be opening its doors on October 5. “We have got all the necessary permissions from the authorities and the safety measures are in place to start our operation from the 5th of next month. The rowing will be open for all members of the club --- be it amateurs or state-level and national-level athletes,” a senior MBC official told TOI.

It is learnt that only single sculls rowing will be permitted in the beginning. “Strict social distancing norms mean that we will only allow singles sculls rowing. Rowers will have to sanitize the boats after their sessions end,” said Balaji.

In a bid to keep the rowers in peak physical condition during the lockdown period, MBC had even leased out its ergometers. “MBC has a few ergometers which are basically indoor rowing machines. They leased it out for nominal charges so that rowers like us get the much-needed physical training during this period,” said Rohith. With MBC resuming its operations now, rowers have been asked to return the ergometers.

Balaji Maradapa, vice-president of Rowing Federation of India (RFI), is hopeful that the third rowing facility in the state --- Kodaikanal Boat Club --- will be opening its doors as well.

“There was an issue between the Kodaikanal Boat Club and the municipality regarding the water usage. But I am sure it will be sorted out in the coming days,” Balaji told TOI. Kodaikanal Boat Club is the only high-altitude rowing facility in India and many national rowers have benefitted from training there in recent years.

"“I need a break from this relationship,” may not be the best approach for you to ask your partner for some alone time. Amongst hanging out with each other everyday and spending most of the time together, it’s understandable that you would want some ‘me’ time. You can be super happy and in love, yet you might want some time to yourself. That’s perfectly okay.Some partners take this in a stride and even admit that they’ve been wanting to binge-watch a series by themselves or have some alone time. However, others might freak out and start wondering if the relationship is coming to an end. For some, staying away from their partner may rise feelings of rejection or pain. This can be a difficult and tricky situation.But do not fret. We’ve rounded up some interesting ways in which you can convey your view to your partner. This will not only increase the understanding between you both but may leave your partner craving for some alone time as well!Be mindful of what you say. Your tone and choice of words really matter so that your partner doesn’t feel that it’s a threat to the relationship. Thread your words carefully and try being assertive in your approach. Instead of relaying the request from your perspective, try pitching in for your partner too—“the exhaustion at work is too much. Probably we need some time alone to figure out our schedules and clear our mind. This space can only benefit us positively in our professional and personal lives.”You may feel the need to figure out yourself, but your partner may not understand what exactly is alone time. They may feel that this equals to needing a break from emotions as well. You have to put your best foot forward in making them understand that this isn’t the case. With compassion and understanding, say that you need a minute to grasp yourself and you’ll be back to snuggle again.This is quite a sensitive matter that you need to approach with a cool head. Your partner may sulk or get into a bad mood, but you should remain firm in your decision. A relationship works when both the individuals are transparent and can understand each other. Your partner may feel bad, but again, both of you need to maturely handle this situation. Remember: you can take care of your needs and still be considerate towards your partner.Since you’re walking on a tightrope here, you can add a planned date afterwise to ease the current situation. Nothing will make your partner happier than you returning calmer, gleeful and ready to give a 100% into the relationship. A planned candle-night dinner or a movie night marathon is a great way to let your partner know that you’ll be ever-ready to bounce back. This move will definitely strengthen your bond further.Carefully consider these points and convey them to your partner. Fear not because soon after your ‘me’ time you’ll be ready to engage in some ‘we’ time.",How to politely tell your partner you need solo time in your relationship

It has been a very difficult phase for us rescuing all these lost and confused pets"" she says.As these animals also reach to her at the Pawsitive Farm Sanctuary she runs for rescue and rehabilitation, where she is already taking care of 111 dogs and cats, she voices how the choice rests with humans. ""Animals love selflessly. They forgive, they forget and they live and love like there is no tomorrow. They are free children of God and have been made to remind us of these virtues. They can not protest when their voice is not heard. What we do comes back to us in multifold, be it good or evil. The choice rests with us. I have been blessed to be able to bring them home, to be able to take care of them, to stand up for them"" she adds.After much advocacy, many activists are now reversing the situation by helping find the furry babies a better and forever home with those who would take care of them. ""Change happens because of a few good people. The more we try and help, the more there will be a change. So be more kind and compassionate towards your pets, these are confusing times for them too"" she concludes.","The pandemic has been a difficult phase for pets, say activists"
"However, even though some groups are running 'short' of volunteers, there are others who are not accepted into phase III trials. Oxford-AstraZeneca, which is one of the most promising vaccine candidates is running phase III trials in India as 'Covishield'. While the testing is seeing an active response from the public, recent reports have suggested that at least seven participants have been found ineligible for vaccine testing, as the Serum Institute of India began phase III testing at a government facility in Pune.

According to an agency report, the volunteers in question were disqualified because of medical reasons and would be screened again this week.

""All seven candidates who were selected on Monday have become ineligible due to various medical reasons, including antibody test coming positive for some...Some more candidates have been screened today (Tuesday) and if their results in the antibody and COVID-19 tests are negative and if they are eligible on other medical grounds, they will be administered vaccine candidate..""

It should be noted that while volunteers, in any trial have the option to opt-out or leave the trial at any time, there are specific guidelines as to who can enrol for the trial, be tested on, followed globally.","Coronavirus vaccine: 7 participants disqualified from Oxford phase III trials, here are factors that are considered"
"Drugs known as sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are associated with a lower risk of major heart problems in patients with type 2 diabetes than dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, say, researchers.According to the study, published in the journal The BMJ, previous trials have shown that SGLT2 inhibitors can reduce the risk of heart conditions such as heart attack, stroke, and heart failure compared with placebo.But some of these trials had important limitations, making it difficult to interpret the results, and data on the effects of individual SGLT2 inhibitors on the heart are limited.So the research team from McGill University in Canada set out to compare the risk of cardiovascular events between SGLT2 inhibitors and DPP-4 inhibitors among adults with type 2 diabetes in a ""real world"" clinical practice setting.Their findings are based on healthcare data from seven Canadian provinces and the UK from 2013-18 (a total of 209,867 new users of an SGLT2 inhibitor matched to 209,867 users of a DPP-4 inhibitor).Major cardiovascular events (a combination of heart attack, stroke or cardiovascular death), as well as heart failure and death from any cause, were recorded for an average of 11 months.Compared with DPP-4 inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors were associated with a reduced risk of heart attack, stroke or cardiovascular death combined (11.4 events per 1000 person years vs 16.5 events per 1000 person years).""SGLT2 inhibitors were also associated with decreased risks of individual events,"" the researchers wrote.According to the researchers, results were similar in subgroups defined by patient age, sex, past insulin use, and history of cardiovascular disease.This is an observational study and the researchers point to some limitations, such as relying on prescription data over a relatively short follow-up period.They cannot rule out the possibility that other unmeasured (confounding) factors may have affected their results. However, results were consistent across several analyses, suggesting that they withstand scrutiny.These findings suggest that SGLT2 inhibitors offer cardioprotective benefits among people with type 2 diabetes in a real-world setting, although additional studies are needed to determine if these benefits persist long term.",Common diabetes drug linked to low risk of major heart issues
"The UK could be the first country in the world to carry out Covid 'challenge trials', where healthy volunteers would be deliberately infected with coronavirus to test possible vaccines, a report said.According to the BBC, the UK government said that it was holding discussions about developing a vaccine through such ""human challenge studies"". No contracts have yet been signed.Alastair Fraser-Urquhart, an 18-year old university student, is planning to volunteer for the trial if it is given the green light to go ahead.""I think the challenge trial has the potential to save thousands of lives and really bring the world out of the pandemic sooner. It is just something that made instant sense to me,"" AFraser-Urquhart was quoted as saying in the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.Speaking on the same programme, Peter Horby, professor at the Oxford University, said that he thought the trial is a good idea with real potential to advance science and get a better understanding of the disease.Horby said that it is likely that the volunteers would be observed very closely and their immune systems would be monitored to see how they respond to the virus.There are -- perhaps surprisingly -- lots of young and healthy people ready to volunteer for the coronavirus challenge trials. It would be a way of finding out, almost immediately, whether a vaccine works. And it could help speed the selection of the promising coronavirus vaccines.According to the report, the health of the volunteers would be monitored round the clock at a clinical research facility in London.",Coronavirus vaccine: UK volunteers could be injected with coronavirus to test vaccines

"Dean Jones, one of the finest batsmen and a great commentator, passed away due to a massive cardiac arrest in Mumbai yesterday. Dean Jones’s double century in Chennai during the 1986 tied Test match is still a talking point among cricket fans. In a chat with us, former Indian captain Krishnamachari Srikkanth, who was part of the Test match, and Suhail Chandok, who has hosted many shows with the late cricketer, fondly remember the Australian cricketer.Recalling his memories of Dean Jones, Srikkanth said, “It’s very shocking. I don’t know what to say. I’ve played a lot of cricket with him. He was an extraordinary batsman who scored runs in all kinds of wickets across the world.” He added, “I can never forget that double century in the Madras Test in 1986. He really couldn’t bear the September heat of Madras. In spite of that, he continued to bat, drinking water, and got a brilliant double hundred. I can only say my condolences to his family members and may his soul rest in peace.”Dean Jones , who shared the nuances of the game with his fans, used to be called Professor Deano for his analytical skills. Srikkanth said, “He knew the game very well, he was a good reader of the game.”Television presenter Suhail Chandhok, who had presented several shows with Dean Jones said, “We’re wrecked and I’m truly gutted. It’s hard to process it. To me, he was a legend. But more than anything, he was a friend. I’ve probably done nearly 70 percent of my broadcasts with him, including his last show, which he had lit it up as ever. We used to talk about golf, life, family and cricket. He was a legend in his own right. He changed the game in many ways in ODI cricket. He brought life to every room he went to. He lit up each room, he lit up each show and he lived life to the fullest. It’s a privilege to have learnt from him, to have worked with him, commentated alongside him and been together on and off the field as friends. It’s a shock to all of us and my thoughts are with Jane (his wife) and his kids. I can't imagine what they’re going through.”",Krishnamachari Srikkanth and Suhail Chandhok recall memories of Dean Jones
"“It’s a breezy ride through all of humankind’s big failures, with the perspective of how those failures have led to huge discoveries and growth that impact our life to date,” says playwright Prashanth Nair, while explaining how the plot of The Importance of Failing Fabulously! is apt for times like these. It’s a first-of-its-kind live, interactive, online performance by Bengaluru-based theatre group Tahatto. Prashanth had started writing the play for stage before the pandemic brought the world to a standstill. But mid-way through when the lockdown began and there was a sudden resurgence of the digital space, the playwright and his collaborators, Piyush Agarwal and Badarivishal Kinhal, were quick to adapt the piece for the tiny, rectangular windows on a video platform. Lately, a number of recorded performances have been streamed online, giving performance lovers access to a large repertoire of theatrical gems, but The Importance of Failing Fabulously! goes a notch higher — it enables the audience to interact with the actors. And all of this made possible even as the four cast members — Karun Pahwa, Nithya J Rao, Sannidhi Surop and Oliver E Gibbs — rehearsed and acted in the play from their respective homes.“The idea behind this process was also to invite the audience to come and watch a performance in a manner that they have never done before. Luckily, people responded to us with a sense of curiosity, wondering how the play is going to replicate the aspect of ‘nowness’ between the performers and the audience. At various stages of the play, the audiences are asked questions, the responses to which impact the plot accordingly, making it an interactive experience and not just a passive watch. Although we cannot see the audiences’ expressions and how they are reacting to things, through this format, there has been some sense of reaching out via the screen,” explains Prashanth.","Playwright Prashanth Nair on Tahatto’s new interactive, online play"

"Poles were left shaken and stirred by news that a suspected British agent called James Bond was on Her Majesty’s secret service in the country in the 1960s, after the Institute of National Remembrance (IPN) posted about him on social media.According to the institute’s archive James Bond came to Poland on Feb. 18, 1964 and was officially employed as an archivist for the British Embassy Military Attache. He soon came to the attention of Polish counter-intelligence officers.“We know he was in Poland ... in 1964 and 1965,” Marzena Kruk, director of the IPN’s archive, told Reuters.“He travelled a bit around Poland ... he liked women, the same as his literary namesake, but there is not even a word about Martini,” she said, referring to the fictional character’s favourite tipple. “However, there is information that he liked Polish beer.”Bond was under strict surveillance, and visited the Bialystok and Olsztyn regions of northeastern Poland to try and “penetrate military facilities” in the Soviet satellite state, according to the files.However, he was found not to have made contacts with Polish citizens, which would have had serious consequences for any Poles suspected of working with agents from the other side of the Iron Curtain.The British agent 007 created by author Ian Fleming hit the silver screen in 1962 when actor Sean Connery played the character in the film “Dr. No”, leading some to suspect British spies may have been playing a joke on their Polish counterparts with their choice of pseudonym.“Maybe it was a bit of fun with Polish counter-intelligence, maybe he had a sense of humour,” Kruk said.","The name's Bond, seriously: 007's namesake found in Polish Cold War archives"

"Since the coronavirus pandemic hit the world eight months ago, people have been more cautious than ever. Be it washing their hands or sanitizing the groceries, necessary precautions are taken by one and all. When it comes to sanitizing homes, you might clean the door knobs and kitchen on a daily basis to keep the virus at bay. But have you thought about how often you should clean your bathroom, which is the most used part of your home these days? Read on to read about the right way to disinfect toilets and keep your bathroom squeaky clean.Since all of us are frequently washing hands these days, the bathroom has probably become the most visited room in the house. While it is best if everyone in the family has a separate toilet, to maintain optimum hygiene, you can follow the below given tips if you share the bathroom with other family members.As a part of toilet hygiene, you must always wipe the seat after using it. Keep a toilet paper roll handy and use a dab of disinfectant to clean the seat after usage. This will not only make the washroom look more presentable to the next person who uses it but will also keep the hygiene factor high.Wash basin usage has increased considerably in the past few months as everyone is home and has resorted to cleaning their hands, thanks to the pandemic. With most people working from home, the wash basins are used more than before. While you might sanitize your hands by washing them for 20 seconds with soap and water; how sanitized is the tap which is touched every time you are done washing the hands? In order to keep the basin area clean, make sure you disinfect the taps from time to time. It is best to close the tap using your wrist or elbow after you are done washing your hands. Usually, the taps should ideally be disinfected at least 2-3 times during the day.Disinfect the door knobs, bathroom seat, wash basin and taps on a daily basis with soap water. Be cautious while using the toilet and always leave it sanitised for the next person. If anyone in your family is sick or is experiencing symptoms, it is best to isolate them and make them use a separate bathroom.You need not panic-clean as it won’t help in any manner. Direct every individual in the family to maintain optimum hygiene and follow the sanitization protocol properly to keep the bathroom neat and tidy.",How often should you clean your toilet
"Nothing livens up a dish like fresh herbs, which is why you should always have some on hand. And the best way to do that? Grow them right inside your own home. Whether you just want some fresh basil or you're looking to grow a whole host of herbs—and whether or not you're known for your green thumb—there are plenty of gorgeous indoor planters and gardens that can make your dream a reality.There are so many varieties for a mixture of looks in the garden. You can find basil with dark purple leaves, large green leaves, and small, fine-cut leaves that make them valuable additions to the landscape. If you don’t always pinch off the blooms, you’ll have pretty flowers also, although pinching them off will make the flavor in the leaves stronger.Basil is an amazing herb to use – especially when you can get it fresh from the garden. A favorite classic basil dish is homemade pesto. It’s a must in almost every Italian dish and adds a really fresh flavor to salads, tomatoes, omelets, stir-fry dishes, and more.Sage is another great herb that belongs in every herb garden. Sage is a drought-tolerant plant, which makes it good for growing in containers or raised beds. Because it is a perennial, it will often survive for a couple years in the home garden. I love that sage is available in colored and variegated forms, making it an eye-catching accent in the garden, and the textured leaves are always attractive.No herb garden conversation is complete without a mention of delicious and easy-to-grow mint. Mint is so easy to grow, in fact, that it will often spread through the semi-shade areas of the garden. If you want it to stay in one place, I recommend growing mint in containers.Another great herb is chives. You can harvest chives as needed throughout the entire growing season. They are easy to grow because you can either start the plants from seed or get clumps of divided plants from fellow gardeners. They aren’t fussy in the garden as long as they don’t get too hot.Coriander enjoys a sunny position but appreciates a little shade during the hottest part of the day. Plants will run to seed more quickly if stressed by hot weather so this is important for leaf varietiesYou can also grow coriander successfully in pots or trays filled with a good multipurpose compost. Coriander plants have deep tap roots so pots need to be at least 25cm deep. Scatter seeds on the surface of the compost and cover, watering well. In a pot of 25cm diameter you can sow approx 5 seeds per pot.",5 indoor herb planters that will add a new life to your kitchen
